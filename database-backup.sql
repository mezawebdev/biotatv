Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">Bridget Willard <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href="https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href="https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:373:"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier.

The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice!

Over the course of a few months he started going deeper into learning about writing WordPress plugins and produced <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a>, a role management plugin for WordPress. The first major overhaul of the plugin came in 2015 with version 1.0&#8217;s expansion of features and a new UI for editing roles.</p>\n<p>Members has built up a user base of more than 100,000 active installs since it first <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">launched in 2009</a>. Tadlock estimates that over the last couple years, 40% of <a href="https://themehybrid.com/" target="_blank">Theme Hybrid</a> customers are primarily there for support and small tweaks to the Members plugin. He decided it was time to begin investing more in the plugin and its community.</p>\n<p>Tadlock released <a href="https://themehybrid.com/weblog/members-version-2-0" target="_blank">Members 2.0</a> this week. The plugin manages core WordPress capabilities but 2.0 adds the ability for plugins to register custom capabilities. The labels for the capabilities can be internationalized so users can manage the plugin in their own languages in human-readable form.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-human-caps.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also adds the ability to use the WordPress editor for writing custom post error messages, making it easy to direct visitors to registration or other important information regarding access to the content.</p>\n<p>Members 2.0 lets users add multiple roles when creating a new user from the Add User screen. It also introduces the ability to bulk add or remove roles from users, even when multiple roles have been enabled.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-bulk-users.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version of the plugin serves some of its data using the WP REST API and a new setting was added to authenticate users who are accessing the REST API endpoints. This protects content from being exposed on sites that have the &#8220;private site&#8221; setting enabled. Tadlock plans to write a tutorial about what he has learned in integrating the REST API with the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Tadlock Aims to Monetize Members with Add-Ons, Renews Efforts to Develop a Community of Add-On Developers</h3>\n<p>Members 2.0 introduces a new Settings screen that ties in with Tadlock&#8217;s future plans to monetize the plugin. The new screen includes a view for add-ons. Tadlock has two add-ons available currently and has written an API for third-party developers to register their own add-ons to be visible on this screen.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-addons.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to create some small add-on plugins,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;There&#8217;s already two:  <a href="https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels" target="_blank">Members &#8211; Role Levels</a>, which is paid, and <a href="https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-hierarchy" target="_blank">Members &#8211; Role Hierarchy</a>, which I was hired to build and was allowed to release to the community for free. I&#8217;ve got a few small plugins like those in mind that&#8217;ll be in a lower price range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also plans to release a more robust version of the &#8220;Content Permissions&#8221; feature as another add-on. He has received numerous feature requests from users over the years about what they would like to see in this plugin. The add-on will offer a variety of different ways to show/hide content.</p>\n<p>I asked Tadlock if he has considered building payment gateway add-ons so users can charge for memberships. He said the idea is on the table.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to build those or someone else,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve mentioned it to some other developers. It would be a good place to start building add-ons.&#8221; His current setup uses Easy Digital Downloads with a couple of plugins to bridge it with Members and ThemeHybrid.com.</p>\n<p>A plugin like Members has the potential to have a large, third-party ecosystem of plugins for payments and additional features, but Tadlock was focused on other projects during the first few years after it launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t actively pursued the add-on angle,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Instead, I focused more on themes during most of that time. Now, I&#8217;m focusing more on plugin development. It&#8217;s my fault for not nurturing a community of add-on developers, which is something I&#8217;m trying to do more of now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said many of the developers he knows are working with Members because they like that it gives them a solid foundation to build on for client work. He hopes to persuade some of them to release some of that code back as commercial add-ons or free plugins in the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<p>Since launching the plugin eight years ago, Tadlock has aimed to make it behave as if it were a natural part of WordPress. At its core, Members is a role and capability management plugin and not a one-size-fits all membership plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more or less a UI over what you could do with code already,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Most of all, it tries not to get in your way. Every membership site has its own unique needs. It&#8217;s tough building something that suits everyone.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather have that foundation of Members just exposing the roles/caps system with third-party add-ons that suit various users&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other membership plugins often try to please everyone or pigeon-hole everything into their custom system. I like more to have a bit more flexibility without the bloat.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:37:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.1 Adds a Dedicated Custom HTML Widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73470";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-1-adds-a-dedicated-custom-html-widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2681:"<p>When WordPress <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries">4.8 was released</a> last month, it introduced TinyMCE functionality to the Text widget.

So far the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191" target="_blank">issue</a> has received 627 &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; emoji and 66 comments from concerned React users who are hoping for a change in licensing.</p>\n<p>Many respondents on the thread said that ASF&#8217;s decision affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React in projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apache CouchDB and others will switch away from React if we have to,&#8221; CouchDB committer Robert Newson <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315596902" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather not, it&#8217;s a lot of work for no real gain, but we don&#8217;t have a choice. Changing license can be simple (RocksDB completed that change in a day).&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My team, at LinkedIn, is also having legal troubles using React for our internal projects,&#8221; LinkedIn software Denis Ivanov <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316500996" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We would love to see a change on this front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Software developer Clark Evans <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315607798" target="_blank">commented</a> on how React&#8217;s current licensing might affect medical research institutes, and suggested that Facebook consider an Apache 2.0 license because it includes equitable patent grants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since U.S. based universities rely upon patent licensing as part of their legislatively mandated technology transfer initiatives, they are growing far more cautious in their due diligence. For this reason, at some universities, software written with React may be shunned. Existing projects using React software may be asked to remove the React software software dependency. Please strongly consider this proposal, since our RexDB work is used at major universities, we do not wish to rework to use a React alternative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion commented that they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other large companies such as mine (Adobe) can&#8217;t use React, Pop, etc. for the very same reason,&#8221; Corey Lucier <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316046522" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d love to participate in the project, contribute to each, etc. but Facebook&#8217;s heavy-handed PATENTS clause is a showstopper.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even mid-size companies like mine (ViaSat) are starting to disallow the use of Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;open-source&#8217; projects for this reason,&#8221; software developer Aaron Yoshitake <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316102045" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to build React web and native apps, but it seems that any sensible legal department will recommend against agreeing to Facebook&#8217;s asymmetric patent grant.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Internal Discussions Continue at Facebook, Re-Licensing Issue has been Escalated to Engineering Directors</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, shared with participants that Facebook is having internal discussions about the re-licensing issue but cautioned them to temper their optimism. He returned to throw some ice on the conversation, which has grown more heated over the past few days, when he said it could only remain an open discussion if everyone involved remains civil. Many participants are concerned about the future of the React-based software that they have already invested thousands of hours of work into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that everyone is frustrated about this issue,&#8221; Abramov <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316223034" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Personally I am just as frustrated to spend time, energy, and emotional wellbeing on legal mumbo jumbo that is preventing people from using React. I would much prefer to spend this time on working together to make it better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the reality of this situation is that the maintainers of React (people like me that you’re interacting on the issue tracker) are not the ones making these decisions. Each of us is doing what we can to show different perspectives on this issue to the people who can make those decisions, and we appreciate your feedback too. But we can only keep discussion open if everyone stays civil and respectful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also pointed out in a follow-up update that a bug tracker isn&#8217;t the best avenue for a legal discussion, especially since most participants are software developers and not lawyers. Many have mistaken the thread as a way to communicate with Facebook but there are just a handful of software developers who are representing the React community&#8217;s concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard you very well, and we have passed on your concerns,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;But repeating the same points over and over in different threads does not help move this forward, and creates a lot of noise and stress for the maintainers who are already empathetic to your cause.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants expressed frustration that the React community cannot participate in the discussions more directly. However, as React is both an open source project and a product of Facebook, the company&#8217;s leadership has the last word on licensing issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that software developers like us are not the best people to discuss legal details,&#8221; software consultant Erik Doernenburg <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316318170" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;However, wouldn&#8217;t the logical consequence be that the Facebook Legal team, who make such decisions, become active in this forum? Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible that all relevant details pertaining to a piece of open source software are discussed in the open? It is incredibly frustrating to have such an important aspect of open software discussed behind closed doors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not known whether Facebook is considering another change to its Patents grant or a complete re-licensing. Participants in the discussion are also concerned about other Facebook open source projects like GraphQL, Relay, React Native, and Flow, which share the same BSD+Patents License and are widely used by the open source community.</p>\n<p>Dan Abramov left an <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316739812" target="_blank">update</a> today to let the community know that no resolution is available this week. However, the update seemed more positive than the first one, which discouraged participants from being optimistic about a change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to point out that there is a real momentum behind this discussion internally,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;There are going to be more meetings next week escalating this up to the engineering directors. As you imagine they are quite busy, so this is taking more time than we thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Again, I can’t promise you any specific conclusion, and there is no clarity on where this will land. But please know there are people working on getting your voice heard.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 22:37:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 282 – Talking WooCommerce with Cody Landefeld";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=73448&preview=true&preview_id=73448";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-282-talking-woocommerce-with-cody-landefield";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3381:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/codyL">Cody Landefeld</a>, Senior web strategist and founder of <a href="https://modeeffect.com/">Mode Effect</a>.

This is the third WordCamp to be held in Croatia, following WordCamp Rijeka (2015) and WordCamp Split (2016). Although it changes cities every year, the camp is known as Croatia’s annual WordCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having WordCamp change cities each year is quite normal for us,&#8221; WordCamp Croatia co-organizer and Zagreb meetup organizer Emanuel Blagonic said. &#8220;A lot of people from other cities travel to meetups too. Our largest meetup in Zagreb, which usually has 80+ people present and 100+ live stream viewers, usually has people attending from a 300km circle around Zagreb. People also travel to Split when there are meetups there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A renewed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/07/18/regional-camps-take-2/" target="_blank">discussion on regional WordCamps</a> is firing up on the WordPress Community team P2 blog, as the topic was discussed at the Community Summit and with recent developments in <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-netherlands-reinstated-for-2018" target="_blank">WordCamp Netherlands being reinstated</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019" target="_blank">WordCamp Asia a possibility for 2019</a>. Croatia is another example of a country where a national WordCamp might benefit the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we started with organizing a WordCamp in Croatia, as a community we hoped that WordCamp will help us boost local communities, thus not having everything centralized in Zagreb (where most other meetups happen, i.e. PHP, Design, UX, JavaScript, Python, etc.),&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;As a community we strongly believe that every region is different and it should be viewed like that. So far we are organizing WordCamps &#8216;no matter what,&#8217; but having a &#8216;national WordCamp would mean more Croatian sponsors and better coverage from national media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Zagreb will be a three-day event, beginning with workshops on the first day as the event has done in previous years. Organizers are planning for 12 workshops in four tracks that will be open to public registration. The main conference will be held Saturday with two tracks. Contributor Day will close out the event on Sunday, followed by a walking tour of the city.</p>\n<p>Friday&#8217;s workshops will be held mostly in Croatian, except a few, such as WordPress Basics and Public Speaking, which will be conducted in English. All of the conference talks this year will be in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Croatia is a tourist country and most of the people here speak good English, which is often used at large tech events,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;With that in mind, every WordCamp so far was (mostly) in English, which means it’s quite welcoming for people outside Croatia, too (Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Germany) – and our community likes to meet new people. Unlike WordCamps, we see Meetups as strong local events so we usually have talks in Croatian there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blagonic said every year so far the WordCamp has had approximately 20% of its attendees traveling from outside Croatia, as the country is relatively small with a population of 4 million. Most attendees travel to the WordCamp from other parts of Croatia.</p>\n<p>Croatia currently has five local meetups, but only the two in Zagreb and Split have enough members to meet regularly. Blagonic said he sees the meetups as a way to help local communities grow and views the WordCamp as &#8220;a celebration of the country community.&#8221; However, he believes centralizing the larger events too much would be detrimental to growing the fledgling WordPress communities in the smaller cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d say that in Croatia (and in the region) we have a young democracy and we still haven’t found the best way to connect with people,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;For example, there are four big cities in Croatia where most of the things happen, and the tech scene is quite strong in them. If you go outside of these four hubs, a lot fewer things happen, which is a problem for people living outside. We believe that having a centralized country is bad for growing local communities (outside these areas) so with changing cities each year and with traveling to other Meetups/WordCamps we hope that we will change how people feel about it. &#8220;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:11:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.5.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"https://odd.blog/?p=89500337";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"https://odd.blog/2017/07/19/wp-super-cache-1-5-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5935:"<p>WP Super Cache is a fast full-page caching plugin for WordPress. Download it from your dashboard or get it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5.0 has been in development for some time. It has a ton of bug fixes and new features. </p>\n<h3>REST API</h3>\n<p>The headline new feature is REST API access to the settings. This will allow developers to create their own interface to the settings of the plugin. Unfortunately it isn&#8217;t yet documented but you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/tree/master/rest">in the rest directory</a>. Start with load.php where you&#8217;ll find the code that registers all the endpoints. Users who access the API must be logged in as admin users. If you want to test the API, see the end of this post.</p>\n<h3>Settings Page</h3>\n<p>We have also simplified the settings page to make it easier to choose which caching method is used. </p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Instead of maybe confusing the user with technical words like PHP, mod_rewrite and WP-Cache we have split them up into &#8220;Simple&#8221; and &#8220;Expert&#8221; delivery methods, and done away with mentioning WP-Cache completely. Simple delivery uses PHP, expert uses mod_rewrite and well, WP-Cache got the boot because it&#8217;s always active anyway.</p>\n<p>WP-Cache caching is always active, but it can be disabled in different ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Disable caching for known users.</li>\n<li> Don&#8217;t cache pages with GET parameters</li>\n<li> Disable caching of feeds</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Headers</h3>\n<p>We <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/287">expanded the number of headers</a> cached by the plugin. The list of headers was borrowed from <a href="https://cometcache.com/">Comet Cache</a>. However, anonymous users will still only see the bare minimum like content-length or content-type. If you need to use security headers like &#8220;X-Frame-Options&#8221; or &#8220;Content-Security-Policy&#8221; you should enable caching of HTTP headers. This unfortunately disables super caching so only WP-Caching is used but it&#8217;s still very fast (and faster in this release than before which I will get to below). You can also use the &#8220;wpsc_known_headers&#8221; filter to modify the list of recognised headers.</p>\n<h3>WP-Cache Reorganisation</h3>\n<p>WP-Cache cache files are split into two files &#8211; one holds the page content, the other (meta file) holds information about the page such as cookies, headers and url. In the past these files were stored in two directories which could become a problem if there were many thousands of those files. Even with only a few hundred files, maintenance could be an issue as deleting related files (like page archives, or copies of the front page) needed every meta file to be inspected.<br />\nNow the files are stored in the supercache directory structure that mirrors your permalink structure. Deleting related files is is simpler and serving files will be faster as the operating system won&#8217;t need to open a directory of thousands of files.<br />\nIf you currently rely on WP-Cache files, the plugin will still look for them where they are, but new WP-Cache files will be created in cache/supercache/example.com/ (where example.com is your hostname).</p>\n<h3>Sitemaps</h3>\n<p>We added support for caching sitemaps, but your sitemap plugin will need to cooperate to get it to work. The sitemap plugin needs to identify the sitemap request as a feed. Jetpack 5.1 now supports this since <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/7397">#7397</a>. You can disable the caching by excluding feeds from caching.</p>\n<h3>Debugging Improved</h3>\n<p>The debug log is now protected by a username/password. For convenience, the username and password are the same but they are a long md5 string:</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Deleting the log file clears it and resets it ready for more logging. Before, toggling debugging would create a new debug log and the old one would be kept around, but not linked, until deleted by garbage collection, and of course they were text files anyone could access.</p>\n<p>This release includes lots of other small bug fixes and changes. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">number of closed PRs</a> for an exhaustive list of those changes!</p>\n<h3>Testing the REST API</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to send POST requests to a web server but one I like is using curl in a shell script. You&#8217;ll need two bits of information from the website:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> The &#8220;wordpress_logged_in&#8221; cookie from your browser.</li>\n<li> The wp_rest nonce which you can get by adding `echo wp_create_nonce( &#8216;wp_rest&#8217; );` somewhere on your site where you&#8217;re logged in. It&#8217;s good for 24 hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My test script looks something like this:<br />\n<code>export NONCE=''1234567890''<br />\nexport COOKIE=''wordpress_logged_in_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=1234567890''<br />\ncurl -v -X "GET" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-WP-Nonce: $NONCE" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Cookie: wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check; $COOKIE" \\<br />\n-d ''{}'' "https://example.com/wp-json/wp-super-cache/v1/settings/"</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href="https://odd.blog/" rel="external nofollow">Source</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:25:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Donncha";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"HeroPress: Becoming Myself Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1978";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=becoming-myself-again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5996:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/071917-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: The WordPress community is, slowly but surely, helping me get rid of my ingrown fear of the unknown, of others." /><p>It’s so easy to become secluded and sit at home, in your own bubble, but it wasn’t until a group of people literally pulled me in with their welcoming atmosphere and demeanor, that I realised that I could function amongst other people as well (even if it was somewhat limited).</p>\n<h3>In The Beginning</h3>\n<p>To understand my bubble, you need to also know a little about me, or rather, about my childhood. I had a less than ideal childhood. I have a great family, lived in a great house, even in the “best country in the world” as they say. And despite this, I say I wasn’t happy with my childhood. My school years were the reason, they were rough. At times I think back and feel like events that unfolded were parts of ridiculous scenes from an over the top movie.</p>\n<p>All in all, the days seemed generic enough, except my school days were a thing of dread. I would suffer physical and verbal abuse throughout my schooldays, even going to and from school, I had no real friends (victim by association is understandably not something a child would want to intentionally walk into. I understand this as an adult, but as a child it’s not that easy).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because of my treatment over the years, I developed trust issues, I got a fear for everyone around me, and it was growing stronger and stronger over the years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I suppressed it, I lied about it, and I got terrifyingly good at the lying part.</p>\n<p>This is why I was drawn to the internet: I didn’t have to interact with people, I didn’t need to go outside where the others were, I could just do my thing and move on. I could live in my own bubble.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>But then the darndest thing happened. I’d been stuck on a project, I needed help, and I turned to a support room for an open source project, for WordPress. If you’ve ever tried to get help in a chat before, you’ll know what kind of an experience it can be, the snarky reactions to your code, the nitpicking of using the wrong terminology, it’s not fun. This place though, they didn’t care that I was not only using the wrong terms, but my entire code was a horrible mess.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where I would usually get the help I needed and move on, popping back in my bubble of solitude, I instead wanted to be like these people, I wanted to use what I learnt to let others get helped.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the years, I all but devote myself to that place. Nobody knew me, I liked staying under the radar, but eventually I got pushed into a team meeting. I was intrigued, so I would watch, I’d say hi, and progressively make my opinions heard. Yet, I would stick to my bubble, once the meeting was over I was back on my own.</p>\n<h3>And Then I Went To WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Until I got to attend my first big WordCamp, the last one held in San Francisco, I was ecstatic! I’d never been to a big conference before, as I didn’t like crowds, but I knew some of the people who would be there. They were people who had been friendly and inviting in the most genuine way imaginable. It’s not easy being worried whenever you’re out amongst people, but this group of people, this community, I didn’t have that fear around them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I somehow made WordCamps my safe space.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They are where I can, if only for a short while, leave that bubble, leave the need to be alone, and be a part of something great!

It allows users to roll back any WordPress.org plugin or theme to a previous version with just a few clicks and also <a href="https://wordimpress.com/beta-testing-wordpress-plugins-with-wp-rollback/" target="_blank">supports beta versions of plugins</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why the plugin is so popular. Navigating buggy updates is a natural part of life when maintaining a self-hosted website and not all users have a separate testing environment for their websites. This tool gives them a basic diagnostic tool and the confidence to apply updates knowing they can easily roll it back in case of a problem. Many reviewers cite the plugin as having been &#8220;a lifesaver&#8221; when applying WooCommerce or Yoast SEO updates that had unexpected results.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/apparently-not-working-for-themes-rollback-on-multisites/" target="_blank">lone one-star review of WP Rollback</a> was given because the user anticipated multisite compatibility and was unable to get it to work. That issue has been solved in the latest update.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordimpress.com/wprollback-wordpress-multisite/" target="_blank">WP Rollback 1.5</a> is fully compatible with multisite networks, giving super admins the ability to roll back extensions from the network plugin/themes screen or from the the plugins/themes screen of the primary site in the network. Sub-sites do not have the ability to roll back plugins and themes for the entire network. The UI for rolling back themes on the network admin screen is identical to the plugin screens, as multisite doesn&#8217;t have the fancy theme preview screen that single site installs have.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 also adds the ability for users to preview the changelog for previous versions of a plugin. This makes it convenient for users to quickly view the changes for each version without leaving the admin.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rollback_changelog.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wordimpress.com" target="_blank">WordImpress</a>, the folks behind WP Rollback, have considered adding core rollbacks and database savepoints, but both features have serious potential drawbacks that could turn it into a high support-demanding plugin. In its current state, the plugin is virtually support-free.</p>\n<p>Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at WordImpress, said the team thought about monetizing the plugin in the beginning, but is not pursing any plans to do so at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think of it as just one of the many ways we are giving back to the WP community,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Our preference would be for the core team to consider it as a potential feature plugin for eventual core inclusion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cromwell said WordImpress hasn&#8217;t made any intentional steps to see if core folks are interested in WP Rollback becoming a feature plugin, but the team has purposely built it to be as close to core standards as possible. He believes it would be relatively easy to implement in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for new features, general feedback, and bug reports are welcome on WP Rollback&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/WordImpress/WP-Rollback" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. The plugin&#8217;s authors recommend backing up your site before using it to rollback plugins and themes or testing rollbacks on a staging site first. WP Rollback is not capable of rolling back changes a plugin update has made to the database, so a backup can come in handy if the database changes are incompatible with previous versions.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 22:24:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:136:"WPTavern: React Users Petition Facebook to Re-license React.js after Apache Software Foundation Bans BSD+Patents License in Dependencies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73216";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:146:"https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9983:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/apache-software-foundation.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Apache Software Foundation <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303?focusedCommentId=16088663&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16088663" target="_blank">issued a notice</a> over the weekend, indicating that it has added <a href="https://code.facebook.com/pages/850928938376556" target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license</a> to its <a href="https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved#category-x" target="_blank">Category X list of disallowed licenses</a> for <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html" target="_blank">Apache PMC members</a>. This is the license that Facebook uses for most of its open source projects.</p>\n<p>A representative from Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb" target="_blank">RocksDB</a> team <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303?focusedCommentId=16088730&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16088730" target="_blank">commented</a> on the Apache Foundation&#8217;s post to advise that the project will meet the August 31st deadline for relicensing in order to be in compliance with Apache PMC member requirements, and that change has been <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/3c327ac2d0fd50bbd82fe1f1af5de909dad769e6" target="_blank">committed</a> today:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The RocksDB team is adjusting the licensing such that it will be dual-licensed under the Apache 2 and GPL 2 (for MySQL compatibility) licenses. This should happen shortly and well ahead of August 31st. I&#8217;ll leave the history and philosophy around licensing alone since it&#8217;s generally a complex discussion to have and I&#8217;m not sure that it has actually been fully captured in this thread especially vis a vis Facebook&#8217;s intent.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this morning&#8217;s guidance to PMCs can be adjusted since I don&#8217;t think any of us see a bunch of extra engineering effort as a desirable thing across the ASF projects which are already making use of RocksDB</p></blockquote>\n<p>In light of the ASF Legal Affairs Committee&#8217;s decision to disallow the BSD+Patents License in Apache projects, ASF member Joan Touzet opened an issue on the React repository urging Facebook to consider re-licensing React.js under Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThis has led to a lot of upset and frustration in the Apache community, especially from projects requiring similarly-licensed code as direct dependencies &#8211; the chief of these being RocksDB.</p>\n<p>We (the Apache Software Foundation) have just received word that RocksDB will be re-licensing their code under the dual Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2 licenses.</p>\n<p>As a user of React.JS in an ASF top-level project (Apache CouchDB), please consider re-licensing React.JS under similar terms. Otherwise, many ASF projects such as our own will have to stop relying on and building with React.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the re-licensing of RocksDB solves that particular project&#8217;s problem, ASF&#8217;s ban of Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license means other widely used technologies from Facebook, including React.js, are still banned. This is likely to cause problems for many open source projects.</p>\n<p>Harshavardhana, from the <a href="https://www.minio.io/" target="_blank">Minio</a> team, commented in support of the petition to Facebook for re-licensing React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our object storage browser UI is based on React and we are Apache 2.0 licensed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be unfortunate and time consuming to migrate but we will have to do that in lieu of new information regarding Apache incompatibility. Please consider re-licensing React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors to <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om" target="_blank">Om</a>, a ClojureScript interface for React, are also <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/issues/882" target="_blank">discussing whether or not the ASF&#8217;s new requirements will affect their project</a>. Greg Stein, commenting on behalf of ASF, clarified the reasons behind the organization&#8217;s decision to ban Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please note that the ASF chose this path for policy reasons, rather than &#8220;license incompatibility&#8221;. We don&#8217;t want downstream users of Apache code to be surprised by the PATENTS grant that (was) in RocksDB and (is) in React. Users should only need to follow the ALv2, with no further constraints.</p>\n<p>These license can work together (IMO) and simply provide two sets of restrictions upon users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stein said it was not ASF&#8217;s lawyers who made the decision but rather the organization&#8217;s policy decision to &#8220;disallow FB/BSD+Patent license to be mixed into the software the Foundation releases to users.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Facebook is Internally Discussing the Re-Licensing Matter</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315707719" target="_blank">joined the discussion on GitHub</a> regarding re-licensing with a brief and ambiguous summary about how Facebook is handling the petition to re-license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you a small update, there are going to be more internal discussions about this for about a week,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;This is about as much as I can say. I wouldn&#8217;t be too optimistic about this changing for React but we&#8217;ll see. @daveman692 has kindly agreed to provide an update when these discussions are over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dropping the patent grant entirely, which would be the most convenient way of solving this issue for open source projects, isn&#8217;t likely to happen. React has already gone through re-licensing twice during its short history. It was originally licensed under Apache 2.0 but this was changed in October 2014 to the BSD License plus the patent grant, which included a highly controversial termination provision. In April 2015, the patent grant was changed slightly to allow licensees to continue to use the software in the event that a patent lawsuit did not include a counterclaim against Facebook or its affiliates in a matter unrelated to React.js.</p>\n<p>The termination provision in Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents License continues to be unpopular and is regarded suspiciously by many open source project maintainers. When the Drupal project began <a href="http://buytaert.net/selecting-a-client-side-framework-for-drupal" target="_blank">considering a client-side framework to supersede Backbone.js</a>, Dries Buytaert passed on React based on what he said was &#8220;a potentially unacceptable patent clause,&#8221; citing <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650" target="_blank">pushback from WordPress.com&#8217;s Calypso and React contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>The WordPress open source project has not formally announced its decision on which JavaScript framework will be included in core, but all signs point to React. WordPress&#8217; upcoming Gutenberg editor is built on React and its chief contributors are Automattic employees who work on React-based products for WordPress.com. Gutenberg continues to plough forward at a breakneck pace with no indication of a rewrite, and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has been outspoken about his preference for using React.</p>\n<p>Although Automattic&#8217;s legal counsel has said the company is <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause" target="_blank">comfortable using React for its product under the project&#8217;s current license </a>, others in the WordPress community are not as amenable to including the framework in core.</p>\n<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) includes a generic <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent" target="_blank">BSD+Patent license</a> listed among its approved licenses, but Facebook&#8217;s particular BSD+Patent license has not been submitted. Robert Pierce, a partner at El Camino Legal, <a href="https://www.elcaminolegal.com/single-post/2016/10/04/Facebook-Reactjs-License" target="_blank">contends</a> that the license termination provision ought to be impermissible in an open source license because it exists to protect Facebook from patent litigation that is completely unrelated to React code:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Facebook touts React.js as open source software. But in my mind the license termination provision of the Additional Grant of Patent Rights takes the offering outside the realm of open source software.</p>\n<p>The patent license offered in the Additional Grant of Patent Rights (v.2) is conditioned upon the licensee not bringing a patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook or its affiliates. Thus, the licensee pays a price to use the library. It is not a price paid with money. The price demanded by Facebook for use of the library is that the licensee refrain from exercising any of its patent rights against Facebook or its affiliates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pierce views Facebook&#8217;s publication of React source code as leverage to win some protection against patent lawsuits, which he deems to be &#8220;too greedy an approach for Facebook to claim open source status.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The open source community has widely speculated about the implications of including Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patent license as a dependency, but the license has not yet been tested in court. The Apache Software Foundation is the first major organization to take a hard line stance on the controversial license and this has caught Facebook&#8217;s attention. Facebook representatives have promised an update on the petition for re-licensing after its internal discussions have concluded.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 03:25:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Stylishly Display Weather Conditions with the Weather Atlas Widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73229";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"https://wptavern.com/stylishly-display-weather-conditions-with-the-weather-atlas-widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2207:"<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to display weather conditions on your site, check out the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/weather-atlas/">Weather Atlas Widget</a> by <span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/weatheratlas">Yu Media Group d.o.o</a>.

Over the weekend Ahmad Awais released a new project called <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/gutenberg-boilerplate/" target="_blank">Gutenberg Boilerplate For Third-Party Custom Blocks</a>. Awais&#8217; introductory post includes a rundown of his thoughts on the current pros and cons of developing for the Gutenberg project. Although he appreciates the technology behind Gutenberg and the improvements over shortcodes, he is not fully sold on the concept of putting everything into blocks. To learn more, he decided to jump into the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am still making up my mind with how Gutenberg will fit in the WordPress core,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;There are so many things which are both good and bad about it. So, instead of ranting about it, I wanted to do something more productive. I went ahead, studied the source code and received a lot of help from Gutenberg contributors (Matias Ventura, James Nylen, Riad Benguella, Andrew Duthie, Joen, etc.) to finally build a Gutenberg Boilerplate project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais&#8217; <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-Boilerplate/" target="_blank">Gutenberg Boilerplate</a> is a good starting place for learning more of the basics about developing for the editor. It comes in the form of a plugin that offers four examples of how to build different kinds of custom Gutenberg blocks, with and without a build process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A block with custom CSS for editor and front end</li>\n<li>A block with ES6 or ESNext and a Webpack build process</li>\n<li>A block with editable content</li>\n<li>A block to click Tweet the contents of that block</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the tweet block, which is something that might previously been handled with a shortcode, is an example that includes four files: block.js to register the custom Gutenberg block, editor.css, style.css, and index.php.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-gb.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Awais noticed that many developers were wanting to try building third-party blocks, but Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation for this was outdated and/or non-existent. He got involved in contributing to the project&#8217;s documentation after discovering the docs describing how to enqueue block and block editor assets were not available. This gave him the inspiration to create a boilerplate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both as a theme/plugin developer, I think there’s going to be a steep learning curve here for just about everyone &#8211; users as well as developers,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;WordPress development just became very complicated with the Gutenberg project. I&#8217;m also not sure how devs will start writing extensions. Some users might expect them to keep the shortcodes for the old editor. Some might ask for blocks in the new one. Is there an API or back-compat? In short everything is changing and this change has both pros and cons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These concerns also tie into the larger discussion around <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952" target="_blank">how Gutenberg can support legacy metaboxes that use the old PHP framework</a>, instead of updating to the new JS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;New metaboxes should be written in JS, and will appear in the Post Settings sidebar alongside the stock ones,&#8221; Gutenberg contributor Joen Asmussen said. &#8220;Metaboxes written in PHP should ideally be upgraded to be JS, but should continue to work in their PHP form also.&#8221; Asmussen has proposed an &#8220;Extended Settings&#8221; panel to house legacy metaboxes in a section below the editor. It would appear only when legacy plugins and metaboxes are enabled, as shown in the mockup below.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/extended-settings-mockup.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Discussion regarding how to support metaboxes is still ongoing. With so many important issues like this up in the air, it&#8217;s too early to know what the future of extending Gutenberg will look like. At the moment, the project is undergoing rapid development and changes, so extending Gutenberg may evolve drastically over a short period of time. If the editor is to preserve the same flexibility and customization opportunities of its predecessor, the project will need to ensure that it is easy to create custom blocks and extensions while continuing to support older PHP metabox infrastructure that is currently widely used.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 20:28:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.5.0 Adds New Verse Block for Poetry and a New Display for Recent Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72830";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-5-0-adds-new-verse-block-for-poetry-and-a-new-display-for-recent-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5718:"<p>Another round of Gutenberg updates was released today. Last weekend brought <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-8th/" target="_blank">version 0.4.0</a>, which didn&#8217;t have too many noteworthy visible changes on the frontend but introduced an API for handling pasted content. Gutenberg developers are aiming to have specific handling for converting pasted content from applications like Word, Markdown, and Google Docs to native WordPress blocks. Version 0.4.0 also added navigation between blocks using arrow keys and included a new approach for rendering embed frames.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14th-july/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 0.5.0</a> hit dashboards today. One major improvement to the writing flow is that the editor will now avoid showing block UI while the user is typing and/or starting a new paragraph in a text block. You can test this by typing and pressing enter twice to begin a new text block. No UI should be visible during this process. Small improvements like this one are gradually bringing a bit more zen to the editor, which is still full of confusing and surprising experiences.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5.0 adds the ability to upload images via drag-and-drop onto image block placeholders. The example below shows one of my tests. While the image is uploading, it fades in and out. This experience is a bit disconcerting, especially if the upload never resolves. I&#8217;m not certain this UI provides the best communication for the status of the image upload.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version also introduces a new Verse block, which is intended for poetry. It has a slight indent, as compared to a plain text block, but it doesn&#8217;t yet work well with copy and paste. Unless you are a poet composing in WordPress, it&#8217;s far more likely that you will be pasting in poetry content from somewhere else on the web. Other than the initial bugs, it&#8217;s a useful block for those who often post verse.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/verse-block.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the growing number of block types, it can be cumbersome to sort through all of them when adding a new block. Gutenberg 0.5.0 implements a new display for recent blocks. A maximum of eight are shown and the most recently used ones are displayed at the top. It does not yet persist between editor sessions, but Gutenberg contributors plan to add that in the future.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/recent-blocks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable improvements in this release include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1833" target="_blank">New tabs mode for the sidebar</a> to switch between post settings and block inspector</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1816" target="_blank">Display warning message</a> when navigating away from the editor with unsaved changes</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1872" target="_blank">Mobile implementation</a> of block mover, settings, and delete actions</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1852" target="_blank">Search through all tabs</a> on the inserter and hide tabs</li>\n<li>Enable <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1889" target="_blank">ability to add custom classes</a> to blocks (via inspector)</li>\n<li>Add <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1896" target="_blank">“table of contents” document outline</a> for headings (with empty heading validation)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Writing Long-Form Content with Gutenberg is Still a Frustrating Experience</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg in its current state is a long way away from being an editor that users would embrace for long-form writing. It still contains many unnerving bugs that steal user confidence. For example, when pasting in multiple paragraphs from a lorem ipsum generator, the editor gave me a white screen and I lost all of the content in my post. After a bit of testing I found that pasting in paragraphs one at a time worked.</p>\n<p>This kind of frustrating and unexpected behavior has caused many testers to wonder why it isn&#8217;t being referred to as alpha software instead of beta. WordPress contributor Jon Brown summed up this common sentiment in a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-8th/#comment-32799" target="_blank">comment</a> on the 0.4.0 release post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s getting better, but it honestly still feels more like a 0.0.4 alpha than a 0.4.0 beta,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I’ve tried writing long form content several times with each version since 0.1.0 and each time I’m quickly frustrated by the lack of flow between blocks. It’s more frustrating than TinyMCE.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg needs to make significant progress before it can be suitable for writing anything more than a few short paragraphs. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to get into the flow of creating long-form content with the prominence of the block UI. Right now, the editor just gets in the way. The current UI is skewed heavily towards frequent block creation. It is clutter-some and distracting for pure writing tasks. Following the evolution of the editor, with its fast-paced development cycle, is exhilarating after years of stagnation. But the project is sorely in need of a breakthrough where the Gutenberg UI finally gets out of the way of writing.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 05:14:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WPTavern: Jetpack Professional Plan Introduces Unlimited Access to 200+ Commercial Themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73055";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-professional-plan-introduces-unlimited-access-to-200-commercial-themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3407:"<p>Automattic has been teasing its plan to add commercial themes to Jetpack for several months after introducing theme installation for self-hosted users from WordPress.com. In March, the plugin <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-introduces-theme-installation-from-wordpress-com-sparks-controversy-with-alternative-marketplace-for-free-themes" target="_blank">opened up access to all of WordPress.com&#8217;s free themes via the Jetpack Manage interface</a>. All signs pointed to Automattic developing the infrastructure to offer commercial themes via Jetpack upgrades. At that time, however, Jetpack team member Richard Muscat said that Automattic had &#8220;no immediate plans to sell themes at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yesterday those subscribed to the Jetpack Announcements email were notified that <a href="https://wordpress.com/professional-sites/" target="_blank">commercial themes have landed</a> in the <a href="https://jetpack.com/install/professional/" target="_blank">Jetpack Professional plan</a>, which is regularly priced at $24.92/month or $299/year. Customers will have unlimited access to more than 200 commercial themes that are already available on WordPress.com. Jetpack users on the free plan will see all the themes available in the WordPress.com theme browser with a prompt to upgrade for the ones that are commercial.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jetpack-themes.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The announcement also noted that any themes users elect to use will be automatically backed up and regularly scanned for malware as part of the security services included in the package. For those who are running a multisite network, each site will need its own Jetpack Professional subscription to have access to the commercial themes.</p>\n<p>For years the WordPress community has speculated about what Automattic&#8217;s long game was for Jetpack, and many believed it was only a matter of time before the plugin started offering commercial upgrades. It was <a href="https://jetpack.com/2011/03/09/blast-off/" target="_blank">introduced to the WordPress world in 2011</a>  as a way to provide feature parity between WordPress.com and self-hosted sites. The first version included just eight modules, but fellow plugin developer and entrepreneurs in the community were immediately aware of its commercial potential.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-powers-42-of-all-online-stores" target="_blank">identified both Jetpack and WooCommerce as “multi-billion dollar opportunities”</a> that could each individually be larger than WordPress.com. The plugin is now active on more than 3 million WordPress sites. Automattic&#8217;s aggressive commercialization of Jetpack in the past two years is the fulfillment of initial predictions about where the plugin was headed.</p>\n<p>The new commercial themes offering significantly raises the value of the Jetpack Professional plan, which was previously targeted at business users who require unlimited storage, Google Analytics, and additional SEO features. With the addition of unlimited use of 200+ themes, Automattic has expanded the Professional plan to be more compelling for non-business users who are simply interested in gaining access to a collection of professionally-supported themes.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 21:46:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.9.0 Release Candidate 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=267012";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://buddypress.org/2017/07/buddypress-2-9-0-release-candidate-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2980:"<p>Today sees BP 2.9.0 move to The final testing phase <strong>Release Candidate 1</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is the last chance to test out this release and report back any issues found before final release in approximately two weeks time.</p>\n<p>Any issues found can be reported to our <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket"> trac ticket home </a>, or raised on the support forum.</p>\n<p>Amongst other improvements and fixes to look out for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing display of older activity comments.</li>\n<li>Correction of message when removing friends that are not friends.</li>\n<li>Group invites &#8211;

<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Open source software has made its way into nearly every industry, but a recent open source security and risk analysis shows <a href="https://wptavern.com/2017-open-source-security-and-risk-analysis-report-shows-widespread-gpl-license-conflicts" target="_blank">widespread license compliance risks</a>, with 75% of the audited applications including GPL license conflicts. Although most violations are unintentional, there are some cases where companies do not comply with the license in order to block competitors from developing similar software.</p>\n<p>GPL enforcement doesn&#8217;t often lead to litigation. When it does, most other avenues of resolving the complaint have already been exhausted. A lawsuit in the air transport industry is currently bringing more attention to the gravity of not complying with open source software licensing requirements.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.cokinetic.com/" target="_blank">CoKinetic Systems</a>, a developer and manufacturer of in-flight entertainment (IFE) software, has <a href="https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/470007/1-0.html" target="_blank">filed a case against Panasonic Avionics</a> that includes allegations of a fairly egregious breach of the GPL. The complaint alleges that Panasonic Avionics has monopolized the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market by deliberately refusing to distribute the source code for its open-source Linux-based operating system:</p>\n<blockquote><p>More specifically, Panasonic has built the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software using the open-source Linux kernel, which is clearly governed by the GPL, together with Panasonic’s own modified Linux modules, which are likewise governed by the GPL. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Panasonic has itself affirmatively identified its own modified modules as being subject to the GPL, because the original Linux modules were specifically designed to generate warning messages if other code is linked with or otherwise combined with the Linux modules that are not licensed under the GPL. To suppress these warnings, Panasonic willfully acted to insert code into its own modules to indicate that they were licensed under the GPL.</p>\n<p>Panasonic has incorporated a massive amount of open source modules, programs, and libraries into the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software, without distributing notices or source code to the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software, or even to any part of it&#8230;By deliberately refusing to distribute the source code to the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software in accordance with its GPL obligations, Panasonic intentionally deprives competitors in the market from having the ability to develop software that can access the basic features and capabilities of Panasonic IFE Hardware.</p></blockquote>\n<p>CoKinetic Systems contends that Panasonic&#8217;s refusal to distribute its source code voids its GPL license and &#8220;potentially exposes Panasonic to billions of dollars in statutory damages for hundreds of thousands of hardware installations that willfully infringe copyrights belonging to hundreds or even thousands of software developers that freely contributed source code to Linux.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the complaint details how competitors have to rely on Panasonic&#8217;s APIs in order to offer software services to airlines using Panasonic&#8217;s IFE hardware, because they do not have access to the source code for the Linux-based core software. CoKinetic claims that Panasonic also deliberately blocks competitor products by its selective distribution of its APIs, resulting in stifled industry innovation and monopoly control over the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the worst and most grave allegation in the complaint is that, in addition to locking up the source code and doling out access to the APIs, Panasonic also maliciously sabotaged its own APIs in order to give the appearance that it is the only reliable software service provider for its hardware, which CoKinetic claims is inferior and sold at monopolistic prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Panasonic also is able to use its control over the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software in order to make ongoing, undisclosed, and often malicious modifications to its source code, deliberately “breaking” Panasonic’s own APIs in order to purposely and maliciously sabotage the performance of third-party software products that Panasonic deems a competitive threat — particularly CoKinetic software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the introduction to the case, CoKinetic cites a litany of anti-competitive conduct the company has engaged in over the past decade before detailing the current allegations. The case is not purely an open source license dispute, as the plaintiff also alleges that Panasonic abused regulatory processes, engaged in acts of corporate espionage, defamed CoKinetic, paid commercial bribes, and employed unlawful means to monopolize the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market.</p>\n<p>CoKinetic is seeking compensatory damages for Panasonic&#8217;s GPL ongoing GPL breaches. The specific amount would be determined at the trial but the company believes it to be in excess of $100 million. The company also wants the court to compel Panasonic to publicly disclose and distribute the source code.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a case where distributing the source code is just a small sticking point or just a matter of principle. It has the potential to open up the IFE industry for faster progress and greater innovation. Many reading this article have undoubtedly used Panasonic&#8217;s IFE products when flying with the company&#8217;s customers, which include Emirates Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Virgin America, and United Airlines. With the source code available, airline customers could remove Panasonic&#8217;s software from their IFE hardware and replace it with their own software solutions.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/470007/1-0.html" target="_blank">complaint</a>, which was filed in the Southern District of New York in March, demands a jury trial. An initial pre-trial conference was held in May, but the case has been slow moving. The Court gave a deadline for the Defendant to file its motion to dismiss, but deadlines have since been extended. The Court also strongly recommended that the two parties retain a private mediator but it&#8217;s not clear how outside mediation could solve such a far-reaching matter that impacts so many vendors. <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/20747763/CoKinetic_Systems,_Corp_v_Panasonic_Avionics_Corporation" target="_blank">Additional documents</a> are due over the next few months, so it will be some time before there are updates on the progress of the case.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 04:39:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"WPTavern: AJ Morris Acquires iThemes Exchange";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73071";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wptavern.com/aj-morris-acquires-ithemes-exchange";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3545:"<p>In 2013, iThemes <a href="https://wptavern.com/ithemes-launches-e-commerce-plugin-exchange">released Exchange</a>, an e-commerce platform that aimed to make selling online as simple as possible. Today, the company <a href="https://ithemes.com/2017/07/13/ithemes-exchange-new-home-exchangewpcom/">announced</a> that AJ Morris, Product Manager at Liquid Web, has taken over the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When approached about taking over iThemes Exchange early this year, we wanted to be sure the project and our customers went into very competent hands, someone who will love and care for them as much as we do,&#8221; Cory Miller, founder of iThemes, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having spent four and a half years investing in the project and in you and your success, we did not take this lightly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After numerous conversations over the past several months, we believe the best home for Exchange is with ExchangeWP LLC led by AJ Morris.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Everything iThemes Exchange related will transition to <a href="https://exchangewp.com/">ExchangeWP.com</a>. Toolkit, Plugin Suite, Exchange Pro Pack, and iThemes Exchange Add-on customers will be given accounts for free support and upgrades through August 2018 at ExchangeWP.com.</p>\n<p>Beginning today, customers will no longer be able to purchase Exchange or its add-ons through iThemes as the company transfers licenses and products to ExchangeWP. However, iThemes will continue to provide customer support until the transition is completed, expected to happen in early August.</p>\n<p>Morris says he&#8217;ll continue to focus on making e-commerce simple and will provide regular updates to customers to provide insight into what goes into transition a product from one company to another and where the product is heading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These days, it’s very easy to get WordPress up and running so you can start blogging,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;But when you want to add e-commerce to the mix, it&#8217;s a bit different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;With big players like WooCommerce out there, it becomes too much too quickly for the average content producer to get their store up and running.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Exchange is going to continue focusing on the independent publishers that want to keep the revenue they can, while providing a simplistic experience in an easy-to-use e-commerce plugin that will help get their stores online quickly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allowing Morris to take over the project frees up resources for iThemes to focus on three of its flagship products; BackupBuddy, iThemes Security, and iThemes Sync. In addition to their core products, the company says it will soon release a new project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My job as CEO is to be a steward of the time and resources we have at iThemes in order to serve you best,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve realized for a while that it was past time for us to refocus our finite resources on the projects that have the most growth and potential for our company and you.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That meant we either needed to find a new home for Exchange or sunset the project. I’m thankful we didn’t have to do the latter.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://ajmorris.me/">Morris</a> is a <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajmorris">long-time member</a> of the WordPress community and <a href="https://wordpress.tv/speakers/aj-morris/">has spoken</a> at several WordCamps.

This goes beyond the basic <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/publicize/" target="_blank">Publicize</a> functionality that automatically shares posts to connected accounts as soon as they are published, giving users the ability to automate their content marketing to social networks for the most optimal time for sharing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/schedule-sharing.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to know how a post will appear on social networks once it has automatically been shared, which is one reason why many people choose to manually share a post for the best presentation. You want to ensure that the right thumbnail will show up with a message customized for each network&#8217;s particular audience. The new social scheduling feature on WordPress.com includes a built-in preview screen so users can see what the post will look like once it is shared to the network and then make any necessary tweaks.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/social-sharing-previews.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Scheduling social media posts is available on WordPress.com for Premium and Business plan users and for Jetpack Professional and Premium users. On the Premium plan level, which comes in at ~$9/month, users pay less than they would for scheduling apps like Buffer, Hootsuite, or Sprout Social while also getting access to more commercial WordPress features.</p>\n<p>To truly become a realistic replacement for these types of social media marketing apps, WordPress.com would need to offer better analytics tied into the new sharing feature to show how posts are performing at different times and networks. Although WordPress.com allows for unlimited scheduling and users, it would also need to allow sharing to more networks to be more competitive against these apps. For users who don&#8217;t need all of that data but just want the scheduling feature, a paid Jetpack or WordPress.com plan is a more affordable option.</p>\n<p>Several other self-hosted WordPress plugins already <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/schedule+social+media/" target="_blank">offer scheduling social media posts</a> for free and some even integrate the social accounts with Google Analytics. The addition of this feature to Jetpack commercial plans may not be as compelling for self-hosted users who can already find this for free, but it adds value for existing Jetpack customers who may now be able to replace a plugin or third-party service.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 19:59:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 281 – In Memory of Jesse Petersen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=73045&preview=true&preview_id=73045";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-281-in-memory-of-jesse-petersen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2501:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://www.wpsteward.com/">Ben Meredith</a>.

Irving published a few insights from the discucssions that she and her colleagues are applying to their work at Open Collective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing money in open source is less controversial than we thought. The main issues are related to how.</li>\n<li>The coder role is only one among many equally important roles: community builder (for onboarding and creating a healthy ecosystem), documentation writer, fundraiser, and public advocate.</li>\n<li>Companies want to support open source communities. This is now more clear than ever.</li>\n<li>It’s easier for some companies to make in-kind donations rather than cash. We’re working on making this easier, and will share more about it soon.</li>\n<li>Projects that companies publicly support need to have accountability and respect codes of conduct, in order to avoid PR nightmares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the day following the event, SustainOSS organizers tweeted out a link to <a href="https://github.com/sustainers/discussions" target="_blank">a new forum on GitHub for discussing open source sustainability</a>. Proposed topics include fundraising, governance, contributor retention, productivity, and managing corporate relationships. It was created to offer a safe place for open source sustainers to collaborate with each other in the open and contributors have already submitted some practical ideas for discussion, such as <a href="https://github.com/sustainers/discussions/issues/4" target="_blank">adding a standardized FUNDING or SUSTAINABILITY file to repositories</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Busy day, got a lot done.

The basic population, as well as technological development, is concentrated in the central part of the country, in &#8220;city-states&#8221;: Moscow and St. Petersburg. Other regions are much less developed: lower wages, worse and more expensive infrastructure, fewer IT-vacancies and activities.</p>\n<p>I was born and grew up in a remote part of Russia &#8211; in the Far East, in one of the industrial cities, which is located in 7 time zones and 9000 kilometers from Moscow. The Internet, like other technologies, reached there with a significant delay and for a lot of money (unlimited Internet at a speed of 64 kb/s appeared only in 2007), Therefore, at first, the basics of site building had to be learned in snatches with the help of dial-up.</p>\n<p>The first site I did in school. It was built using simple HTML and CSS. But even in this form, it was very impressive and exciting. Then such sites were popular and periodically on the Internet I <a href="http://softphoenix.narod.ru/about.htm">met guys</a> of my age who like me comprehended the science of site building.<br />\nI was lucky to find a like-minded person, with whom we were able to develop together for some time and even launch a joint website.<br />\n<a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1963 size-full" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png" alt="" width="962" height="637" /></a></p>\n<h3>University and start of work</h3>\n<p>Admission to the computer faculty of the university allowed to more specifically address the issues of web development: to learn PHP and MySQL, to get acquainted with a couple of CMS and to make <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100207131804/http://www.compnot.ru:80/">my first blog</a> on WordPress :). As far as I remember, the blog worked on some WordPress assembly using version 2.9. If you count from that moment, it turns out that I somehow have been working with WordPress for almost 8 years.</p>\n<p>In those days, <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org">ru.wordpress.org</a> was just born and there was no main site on the Russian-language Internet. It was a time of amateur assemblies, amateur translations and even <a href="http://book.max-3000.com/page/istorija-sozdanija">alternatives of WordPress</a>, aimed to the Russian segment of the Internet.</p>\n<p>By the will of fate, my first place of work related to website development was the web studio that used Joomla and Drupal. Then there were a few more places of work, during which time WordPress then turned into the main working tool, then returned to the category of extra work and hobbies.</p>\n<p>The turning point was the decision to move to Moscow and a full transition to WordPress in freelance format.</p>\n<h3>Moving to Moscow</h3>\n<p>The scenario of moving to Moscow or St. Petersburg is quite popular among IT specialists of my native region. This is a great chance to find interesting and highly paid job, get acquainted with a lot of IT specialists, including narrow ones, and develop in the area of interest.</p>\n<p>In Moscow, I moved with remote work and I do not have personal experience of employment in this city, but my wife and most of the acquaintances were satisfied with the options found.</p>\n<p>After about six months of living in Moscow, I was even more thirsty for adventure — to become a freelancer and completely concentrate on WordPress. The ability to plan time independently gives additional space for maneuvers and time for reflection. In my case, this led to an increase in activity in the WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>Participate in the WordPress community</h3>\n<p>Actively participate in the life of the community, I started about 1.5 years ago. Initially, these were the replies at the support forum, then the development of my plugins, after which I decided to try myself in translating the extensions into Russian and recording training videos for Russian-speaking users.</p>\n<p>Over time, it turned into a kind of hobby or even a way of life. Every day I read a lot of posts from users on the support forums and try to help resolve their issues, check and correct the added translation lines, periodically record and post training videos.</p>\n<p>Communication with users is very helpful. You are one of the first to learn about the problems and ways to solve them, you can quickly correct some incorrect or incorrect translation. Also, over time, a list of popular questions accumulates, which can be turned into training articles and videos. In turn, the creation of articles and videos helps to structure knowledge and understand the details.</p>\n<p>On <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org">ru.wordpress.org</a> a great team of moderators and translation editors has gathered. We regularly communicate in Slack, some I meet on WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1967" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Denis and Sergey" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>\n<p>In November 2016 I took part in the Global Day of Translation 2. It was an unusual experience: broadcasting from around the world, feeling the scale of what was happening and the excitement of the translation. At that time we took 6th place as the most active locale and attracted 7 new translators.</p>\n<h3>Meetups and WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In Russia there are not so many cities where WordPress-meetups are held, and WordCamp is held only in Moscow. But despite all this, these events are a great opportunity to be among WordPress lovers, to see live people with whom I have only spoken on the network before, and just feel the spirit of WordPress :).</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1968 size-full" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg" alt="Three big cheery guys at WordCamp" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>\n<p>This year I plan to visit WordCamp Moscow for the third time. I visit WordCamp as a participant, but I hope someday I will find a topic close to me and I will decide to apply for a presentation :). I think it will be interesting.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>At the moment I&#8217;m a full-time freelancer. This allows me to quite well combine work and activities in the community. I like to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkgL32ycnfl1hs0nJJD6Og">share knowledge</a> and make WordPress more accessible for Russian users.</p>\n<p>Many resources of WordPress are dominated by English, and some, for example, as <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/">developer.wordpress.org</a> or &#8220;Handbook&#8221; are not available for localization. I hope, in the future this will change and we will be able to expand our activities.</p>\n<p>In any case, WordPress remains the place where you can find yourself and help make life a little better for yourself and the rest of the participants.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id="russian">Как я нашел себя в WordPress</h1>\n<h3>Про Россию и знакомство с технологиями</h3>\n<p>Россия очень большая и очень разная страна. Основное население, как и технологическое развитие, сосредоточено в центральной части страны, в &#8220;городах-государствах&#8221;: Москве и Санкт-Петербурге. Остальные регионы развиты значительно слабее: ниже зарплаты, хуже и дороже инфраструктура, меньшее количество IT-вакансий и мероприятий.</p>\n<p>Я родился и вырос в отдаленной части России — на Дальнем Востоке, в одном из промышленных городов, который расположен в 7 часовых поясах и 9000 километров от Москвы. Интернет, как и другие технологии, доходили туда с существенным опозданием и за большие деньги (безлимитный интернет на скорости 64 кб/сек появился только в 2007 году), поэтому, по началу, азы сайтостроения приходилось познавать урывками с помощью dial-up.</p>\n<p>Первый сайт я сделал ещё в школе. Он был построен на простейшем HTML и CSS. Но даже в таком виде, это было очень впечатляюще и захватывающе. Тогда такие сайты были популярны и, периодически на просторах интернета, я <a href="http://softphoenix.narod.ru/about.htm">встречал ребят</a> моего возраста, которые, как и я, постигали науку сайтостроения.</p>\n<p>Мне повезло найти единомышленника, с которым мы смогли некоторое время вместе развиваться и даже запустить совместный сайт.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png" alt="Very old style web site." width="962" height="637" /></a></p>\n<h3>Университет и начало работы</h3>\n<p>Поступление на компьютерный факультет университета позволило более предметно заняться вопросами веб-разработки: изучить PHP и MySQL, познакомиться с парой CMS и завести <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100207131804/http://www.compnot.ru:80/">свой первый блог</a> на WordPress :). Насколько я помню, блог работал на какой-то сборке WordPress, использующей версию 2.9. Если вести отсчет с того момента, то получается, что я так или иначе работаю с WordPress уже почти 8 лет.</p>\n<p>В те времена <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org/">ru.wordpress.org</a> только зарождался и в русскоязычном интернете не было какой-то основной площадки. Это было время любительских сборок, любительских переводов и даже <a href="http://book.max-3000.com/page/istorija-sozdanija">альтернатив WordPress</a>, ориентированных на русский сегмент интернета.</p>\n<p>Волею судеб, моим первым местом работы, связанным с разработкой сайтов, стала веб-студия, использовавшая Joomla и Drupal. Затем было ещё несколько мест работы, в течение которых WordPress то превращалась в основной рабочий инструмент, то возвращалась в разряд дополнительной работы и хобби.</p>\n<p>Переломным моментом стало решение о переезде в Москву и полный переход на WordPress в фриланс-формате.</p>\n<h3>Переезд в Москву</h3>\n<p>Сценарий переезда в Москву или Санкт-Петербург достаточно популярен среди IT-специалистов моего родного региона. Это отличный шанс найти интересную и высокооплачиваемую работу, познакомится со множеством IT-специалистов, в том числе узких, и развиться в интересующей области.</p>\n<p>В Москву я переезжал вместе с удаленной работой и у меня нет личного опыта трудоустройства в этом городе, но моя жена и большинство знакомых остались довольны найденными вариантами.</p>\n<p>Примерно через полгода проживания в Москве, меня обуздала ещё большая жажда приключений — стать фрилансером и полностью сосредоточиться на WordPress. Возможность самостоятельно планировать время дает дополнительное пространство для маневров и время на размышления. В моем случае, это привело к увеличению активности в сообществе WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Участие в сообществе WordPress</h3>\n<p>Активно участвовать в жизни сообщества я начал примерно 1.5 года назад. Вначале это были ответы на форуме поддержки, затем разработка своих плагинов, после чего я решил попробовать себя в переводе расширений на русский язык и записи обучающих видео для русскоязычных пользователей.</p>\n<p>Со временем это превратилось в некое хобби или даже образ жизни. Каждый день я читаю множество сообщений от пользователей на форумах поддержки и пытаюсь помочь решить их вопросы, проверяю и корректирую добавленные строки перевода, периодически записываю и выкладываю обучающие ролики.</p>\n<p>Общение с пользователями очень помогает. Ты одним из первых узнаешь о проблемах и способах их решения, можешь оперативно исправить какой-то неверный или некорректный перевод. Также, со временем накапливается список популярных вопросов, которые можно превращать в обучающие статьи и ролики. В свою очередь, создание статей и видео помогает структурировать знания и разобраться в деталях.</p>\n<p>На <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org/">ru.wordpress.org</a> собралась отличная команда модераторов и редакторов переводов. Мы регулярно общаемся в Slack, некоторых я встречаю на WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1967" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Denis and Sergey" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>\n<p>В ноябре 2016 я принимал участвовали в Глобальном дне перевода 2. Это был необычный опыт: трансляции со всего света, ощущение масштабности происходящего и азарта перевода. В тот раз мы заняли 6 место как самый активный язык и привлекли 7 новых переводчиков.</p>\n<h3>Митапы и WordCamp</h3>\n<p>В России не так много городов, где проводятся WordPress-митапы, а WordCamp проводится только в Москве. Но не смотря на всё это, данные мероприятия — отличная возможность побыть среди любителей WordPress, увидеть в живую людей, с которыми до этого общался только по сети, и просто почувствовать дух WordPress :).</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1968" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>\n<p>В этом году я планирую посетить WordCamp Moscow в третий раз. Я посещаю WordCamp как участник, но надеюсь когда-нибудь найду близкую мне тему и решусь подать заявку на выступление :).

The company&#8217;s logo has been listed on the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/" target="_blank">Save Net Neutrality</a> event website for some time but it had yet to announce how it would be participating. WordPress.com users are encouraged to send a message to the FCC and also enable the Fight for Net Neutrality Plugin via the dashboard Settings screen.</p>\n<p>The plugin is open source and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/net-neutrality/" target="_blank">available to self-hosted users on WordPress.org</a>. Unlike the existing plugins that support the event on July 12 by presenting visitors with a banner to raise awareness, Automattic&#8217;s plugin simulates what life might be like in the &#8220;slow lane&#8221; if the FCC abandons the principle of net neutrality. It replaces a few of the posts on your site with a “Still Loading” spinner. This plugin doesn&#8217;t seem to offer a way to test it ahead of the event, but it essentially displays a message at the bottom of your website and slows down some of your posts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/net-neutrality-plugin.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin will automatically be disabled after the event has concluded, so both WordPress.com and self-hosted users do not have to worry about turning it off and can remove it later.

VersionPress will automatically detect the definition file as long as each plugin has a .versionpress folder in it.</p>\n<p>With the release of 4.0 Beta, Bernard says a <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/1243">repository</a> containing plugin definitions is next on the list and is encouraging plugin authors to contribute to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The final step is to have an online repository of the definitions,&#8221; Bernard said. &#8220;It will be open to anyone to contribute, not just plugin authors, and used by VersionPress transparently.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For insight on how to create definitions, developers can look at <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/tree/aba96d3f63bc5d84d49019bffa47252f87734288/plugins/versionpress/.versionpress">WordPress core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pavelevap/versionpress-for-woocommerce">WooCommerce</a> for real-world examples.</p>\n<p>Other major changes include full support for WordPress 4.7 and 4.8, adoption of <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/projects/2">GitHub projects</a> to help manage the development process, and <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues?q=project%3Aversionpress%2Fversionpress%2F2+sort%3Acreated-desc+label%3Abug">a number of bugs fixed</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers and users can download <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/releases/tag/4.0-beta">4.0 Beta</a> from GitHub.

Lift founders Chris Wallace and Brad Miller will join 10up&#8217;s 120+ person distributed team, along with Lift&#8217;s director of technology, Christian Chung, and front-end developer Anthony Garand.</p>\n<p>10up is acquiring the Lift UX brand, hiring four team members, and will also take possession of <a href="https://remotejobs.com/" target="_blank">RemoteJobs.com</a>, which will continue operating independently as a remote job board. The Lift UX brand will be dissolved and clients and projects are in the process of transitioning over to 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were always looking for agencies to partner with and when I reached out to 10up I was looking to build a relationship to help work on UX design projects,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;10up has a strong engineering background and I felt like having them as a partner would be huge for our agency. Jake and I quickly realized that Lift UX and 10up had so many similar processes that it sounded like our two companies were the same but just different in size.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With similar expertise serving large clients in the WordPress space, the two companies were bound to end up competing on different projects, which happened during the course of their conversations spanning a year leading up to the deal. Miller said 10up founder Jake Goldman proposed a merger/acquisition type of approach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I ended up speaking to them off and on for the next couple of weeks and things got pretty serious when we were competing for some projects,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;I was of course flattered by the offer. Jake and John were awesome. We enjoyed our conversations and decided to do an onsite to discuss things in more detail. They made an offer after our onsite and Chris and I decided to accept it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 10up&#8217;s announcement, Goldman said it &#8220;takes a special kind of chemistry and alignment for a deal like this to work.&#8221; The company&#8217;s acquisition of Lift is one of the biggest design-driven acquisitions in the WordPress ecosystem in awhile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adding more experience design expertise to our company DNA enhances our empathy and ability to collaborate with design partners in an era of interactive, responsive design where divisions between &#8216;design&#8217; and &#8216;engineering&#8217; have eroded,&#8221; Goldman said.</p>\n<p>Miller, who has worked with Wallace to build Lift into a top-notch design and user experience agency, said that securing design talent is a challenge in the industry. 10up adding a fellow competitor to its team is a stretegic move when design talent is in short supply.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s certainly hard to find quality talent that&#8217;s interested in a full time position,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;There are some amazing designers out there but a lot of them are contractors/freelancers. 10up wanted to find a team that had a big focus on quality design and UX. It didn&#8217;t hurt that we were big on WordPress either.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller and Wallace founded Lift UX in 2009 and will be closing out a chapter of their entrepreneurial lives as the brand dissolves into 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically we&#8217;ll fade into the 10up brand bringing along our team, portfolio, accolades, and ultimately our personality,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>Wallace said closing out this chapter is &#8220;definitely bittersweet,&#8221; but the team is excited to transition into 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a 6-7 person agency, we were all constantly being pulled in a million different directions,&#8221; Wallace said. &#8220;Joining 10up allows us to focus on our individual areas of specialization and excel in each. I love many aspects of entrepreneurship and small agency ownership but the idea of focusing on the success of the experience design team at 10up is something I am looking forward to.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:02:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Donncha: Thank you Translators!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"https://odd.blog/?p=89500320";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"https://odd.blog/2017/07/11/thank-you-translators/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1384:"<p>Well, well. <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-super-cache">WP Super Cache translations</a> are coming along well. 100% of strings in the development version are translated into Canadian English and Romanian!

We&#8217;re still shipping translation files but I think the release after that may ship without and rely entirely on the up-to-date online translations.</p>\n<p>So, thank you so much to the translators.

The two are members of a 20-person team of organizers who will welcome an estimated 2,500 attendees to Nashville in December.</p>\n<p>Although the maximum capacity of the <a href="http://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com/">Music City Center</a> venue is much higher than what is required by WordCamp US, the organizers want to make judicious use of the event&#x27;s resources to put on the best possible event for those who make the effort to attend.</p>\n<p>"At the end of the day, it&#x27;s going to be the right size for the event," Byrne-Cristiano said. "You could say, &#x27;Hey, we want 10,000 people, but that&#x27;s not the right size for the event. The right size is probably somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500. The venue can do more than that, but I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s the main goal. Bigger isn&#x27;t always better. Your main goal is the best event and quality for the people who are already there."</p>\n<p>Meza said he considers WordCamp US to be the premier event for North America and that it is there to represent the communities located in this area.

These include Amazon, GitHub, Kickstarter, Vimeo, reddit, Mozilla, Twitter, Etsy, Spotify, Netflix, and many others. Automattic is joining these tech companies in the protest, as it has several times in the past, including the <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/fight-for-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown event in September 2014</a>. The company also <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2015/09/21/defending-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">reaffirmed its commitment to net neutrality in 2015</a> by filing an amicus brief with the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in the case of United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, joined by Medium, Reddit, Squarespace, Twitter, and Yelp.</p>\n<p>Net neutrality is the principle that ensures people can communicate freely online by prohibiting Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and government entities from favoring, blocking, or throttling certain websites, or charging fees for premium content delivery. It guarantees individuals have free to access all content and applications, and forbids ISPs from discriminating against or prioritizing certain users, equipment, or types of content. Vimeo created a handy video to illustrate the importance of defending net neutrality:</p>\n<div class="embed-vimeo"></div>\n<p>Net neutrality is once again under attack as the FCC is planning to remove the Title II (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier#Telecommunications" target="_blank">common carrier</a>) protections established during the Obama administration.</p>\n<h3>How to Join the Protest</h3>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress site owners who want to participate in the Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality on July 12 can do so by installing the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cat-signal/" target="_blank">Internet Defense League Cat Signal</a> plugin or the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fftf-alerts/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future Alerts</a> plugin. Both support the upcoming Save Net Neutrality event and are based on the <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget" target="_blank">official Fight for the Future widget</a> for the campaign.</p>\n<p>The widget will not display until July 12, so you can add a plugin ahead of time. If you want to test it to see what it will look like on the day of action, you can append #ALWAYS_SHOW_BFTN_WIDGET to your site URL after installing one of the plugins. See an example here: <a href="https://wptavern.com/#ALWAYS_SHOW_BFTN_WIDGET" target="_blank">https://wptavern.com/#ALWAYS_SHOW_BFTN_WIDGET</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/battleforthenet-modal.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The alert urges visitors to contact Congress and the FCC through the provided form. It can be displayed as a banner at the top of the page or as a modal (see example above).</p>\n<p>Automattic may also be planning a way for WordPress.com users to opt-in to participate. We&#8217;ll update the post if that information becomes available.</p>\n<p><em>Update:</em> Automattic has since created a <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-net-neutrality-wordpress-plugin-ahead-of-july-12-protest" target="_blank">Net Neutrality plugin</a> for WordPress.com and self-hosted users who want to join the protest.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 18:12:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"WPTavern: Let’s Encrypt Passes 100 Million Certificates Issued, Will Offer Wildcard Certificates in January 2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72805";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:121:"https://wptavern.com/lets-encrypt-passes-100-million-certificates-issued-will-offer-wildcard-certificates-in-january-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2660:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lock.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/550FJBDFSW">Chris Anderson</a>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt, the free and open certificate authority that launched in 2016, has <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/06/28/hundred-million-certs.html" target="_blank">issued more than 100 million certificates</a> as of June 2017 and is currently securing 47 million domains. Earlier this year, the web passed a major milestone of getting <a href="https://wptavern.com/more-than-50-of-web-traffic-is-now-encrypted" target="_blank">more than 50% of traffic encrypted</a>. Let&#8217;s Encrypt has been a major contributor to that percentage growing to nearly 58%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Let’s Encrypt’s service first became available, less than 40% of page loads on the Web used HTTPS,&#8221; ISRG Executive Director Josh Aas said. &#8220;It took the Web 20 years to get to that point. In the 19 months since we launched, encrypted page loads have gone up by 18%, to nearly 58%. That’s an incredible rate of change for the Web.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aas also announced that <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html" target="_blank">wildcard certificates are coming to Let&#8217;s Encrypt in 2018</a>. Wildcard certificates allow a site to secure an unlimited number of subdomains with the same certificate.</p>\n<p>Currently, the process to get Let&#8217;s Encrypt working on a WordPress multisite installation is much more complicated than adding a certificate for a single domain. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-encrypt/" target="_blank">WP Encrypt</a> plugin claims multisite and multi-network compatibility but super admins have often run into failure on networks with higher numbers of sites. Wildcard support for Let&#8217;s Encrypt will provide a better way to secure multisite networks.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt will offer the wildcard certificates via the new <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/06/14/acme-v2-api.html" target="_blank">ACME v2 API endpoint</a> and will start by supporting base domain validation via DNS with the possibility of adding other validation options in the future. ACME is the protocol that Let&#8217;s Encrypt developed to allow subscribers to acquire and manage certificates. Those using the v1 endpoint are encouraged to move to v2 as soon as it&#8217;s available in January 2018. The v2 protocol was developed to be an IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard so that ACME can work with more certificate authorities in the future.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 18:32:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"WPTavern: WangGuard Plugin Author Shuts Down Splog Hunting Service Due to Trauma and Death Threats";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72733";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"https://wptavern.com/wangguard-plugin-author-shuts-down-splog-hunting-service-due-to-trauma-and-death-threats";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6853:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wangguard.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After seven years of developing and supporting the WangGuard/SplogHunter service, José Conti has <a href="https://www.joseconti.com/2017/07/03/la-verdadera-razon-del-cierre-wangguard/" target="_blank">shut down the server permanently</a> due to the stress and trauma associated with maintaining it. Conti is a WordPress plugin developer and consultant, and a member of the WordPress España translation team. His <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wangguard/" target="_blank">WangGuard plugin</a> identifies and blocks sploggers, unwanted users, and untrusted users on WordPress, Multisite, BuddyPress, bbPress, and WooCommerce sites. It is currently active on more than 10,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Speculation about why the service shut down was running rampant after Conti had <a href="https://wptavern.com/wangguard-plugin-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-development-and-support" target="_blank">collected donations via an Indiegogo campaign in October 2016</a> to fund support and server costs. Since that time SiteGround stepped in to sponsor WangGuard, eliminating the server costs. The only costs that remained were Conti&#8217;s time and effort that he put into supporting the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My purpose with WangGuard was never money,&#8221; Conti said in his post explaining the reason for the shut-down. &#8220;I could have made WangGuard a paid plugin at anytime, and actually had a plan for that for years. But I didn’t do it because there is something inside me that would never let that happen. It was never, I repeat, never my plan to get rich with WangGuard, and I assure you that I could have done it easily: simply charging each of my users 24€/year, would have meant an income of more than 2 million euros per year. I just had to distribute a version of WangGuard I had collecting dust, with a checkbox on WangGuard’s server administration options but I never got it done. No matter the other reasons, which only people very close to me know: I simply didn’t want to, nor did I want to be a millionaire.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Mafia Death Threats and Trauma from Exposure to the Dark Web: The High Cost of WangGuard&#8217;s 99.9% Accurate Detection of Splogs</h3>\n<p>WangGuard has long been known for its nearly perfect detection of registration spam. Not only did it completely block unwanted users, it also removed them from the database. The plugin was unrivaled in both accuracy and price &#8211; all users got everything the service offered for free. In order for WangGuard to provide its 99.90% accuracy, Conti bolstered the algorithm with manual curation and reviews.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WangGuard worked in two different ways: as an algorithm that I had been refining for seven years, and which was getting better as the sploggers evolved, so that it was always one step ahead of them, and also as human curation, in which I reviewed many factors, among them sites of sploggers to see if their content could improve the algorithm and make sure that it worked correctly both when it was blocking or not blocking a site,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;The great secret of WangGuard was this second part. Without it WangGuard would not ever have become what it was.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because of how effective WangGuard was at stopping unwanted users, Conti said for four years he received &#8220;almost daily death threats from mafias for making them lose millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through the process of manually curating splogger sites, Conti caught a glimpse of the some of the darkest places on the web, which he said had a damaging psychological impact on him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For seven years, I have visited places where I saw pederasty, pictures, and videos of murders (by razor blades, by gutting live people, by beheadings, dismemberments, to name a few), real videos of rape of all kinds (children, women, boys), photos of accidents in which people were totally disfigured, bizarre actions that I did not even know existed, and a very long &#8216;and so on,&#8217; which I do not want to expand on,&#8221; Conti said.</p>\n<p>The effects of viewing these types of websites every day took their toll and Conti decided to close the splog hunter service.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Finally, a few months ago, I broke down,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;I disappeared from everywhere and fell into a depression. The seven years of working at WangGuard finally took a toll on me. I had nightmares because of all the macabre deaths I had seen, an obsession with protecting my children from pederasty, OCD, depression, and many other symptoms. It took me about 6 months to recover (and honestly, I may be deceiving myself, since I do not think I completely recovered my life).&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Conti if clicking through to the websites was necessary for maintaining the service. He explained that while WangGuard blocked emails, domains, IPs, and ISPs, without his manual curation of visiting the domains and clicking the links, users could get a lot of &#8220;sleepers&#8221; &#8211; registered and active accounts that remain silent until one day with a 0day vulnerability or a bug fix, they attack thousands of websites. The sleepers also wait to perform actions like create millions of sites on thousands of WordPress multisite installations in order to create a lot of bad content/links.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Visiting many domains, I was able to minimize this problem,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;The way I worked not only fixed the current spam / splog problem, but the wizard and database also fixed any future problems with sleepers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another reason he visited the domains was to figure out what he needed to block, whether it was an email or a domain. The domain could be a spam domain or possibly a free email service.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By visiting a website, I could detect whether it was a phishing website or a site camouflaged as an email service in order to try to cheat WangGuard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw a lot of &#8216;techniques&#8217; for trying to cheat WangGuard at Black Hat specialized forums. I had been subscribed to many spam/sploggers forums for investigation. Every time that a user described a real technique for cheating WangGuard, it was fixed immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still using the WangGuard plugin, it may continue to work but not nearly as well as in the past. Conti said that some parts of the code work without the API, but the most important parts require the WangGuard/SplogHunter server. The plugin is open source, so anyone can fork it. <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-wangguard-was-closed/" target="_blank">An English translation of his original post</a> is available on the WordPress.org plugin forums.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:36:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: WordSesh Asia Now in Planning for 2018, WordCamp Asia Targeted for 2019";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72742";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4161:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wordcamp-asia-meeting-group.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://sakinshrestha.com/events/wordcamp-asia/">Sakin Shrestha</a>\n<p>Yesterday Sakin Shrestha <a href="https://sakinshrestha.com/events/wordcamp-asia/" target="_blank">announced</a> that WordCamp Asia is now in the preliminary planning stages. Shrestha is a key reviewer on the Theme Review Team, translates WordPress to Nepali, and organizes meetups and WordCamps in Nepal. He and other members of the WordPress community in Asia, including representatives from India, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Nepal, had the opportunity to meet at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have been talking about WordCamp Asia informally when some of us attended WordCamp US for the first time,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;That’s was in 2015, where I met Naoko Takano. She is the one with the main idea as the Japanese WordPress community was already doing well. Then we started meeting more people from Asia at WordCamp Europe 2016 and had an informal meeting there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After this meeting, Rahul Bansal created a Facebook group for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpasia/" target="_blank">WordPress Community Organizers in Asia</a> to support each other in a more coordinated effort. The first formal meeting happened at WordCamp Europe 2017 where the team decided that trying for WordCamp Asia in 2018 would be too soon. Instead, they are planning to host a WordSesh Asia event in 2018 to work on their coordination and teamwork. The team is working towards hosting WordCamp Asia in 2019.</p>\n<h3>Organizers Consider Bangkok as a Possible Location for WordCamp Asia in 2019</h3>\n<p>Shrestha&#8217;s <a href="https://sakinshrestha.com/events/wordcamp-asia/" target="_blank">post</a> identifies several challenges that are unique to hosting a large scale WordCamp in Asia, including the need for visas even for travel within Asia, political instability, and numerous currencies and languages in use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Asia is really important for the WordPress community in Asia,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;I am fortunate enough to attend WCUS and WCEU, which are some of the biggest WordCamps where we get to meet lot of WordPressers, share and exchange ideas, contribute to WordPress, start a new business, and think outside of the box. But for most of Asians, it’s really difficult to go that far and also it’s expensive to attain those. So, we are limited to WordCamps in our own country and neighboring ones. That is why we are thinking about WordCamp Asia in Bangkok, which will be really inclusive as it’s in the center part of Asia and it’s cheaper to go there and less time consuming for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shrestha also feels strongly about providing travel assistance for those with financial hardships, as the most expensive aspect of attending a WordCamp is usually the travel and accommodation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamps are not just for the rich,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;The primary motive of WordCamps is to grow the local community. So, WordCamp Asia’s mission will be to influence the community of WordPress Asia and help it to grow. That is why, instead of planning for a grand and pompous event, we need to make sure it is affordable and reachable to people of all financial backgrounds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shrestha said he has seen major changes in working with the WordPress community in Nepal from 2012 &#8211; 2017, which he attributes to having a stronger local presence with the WordCamp. India has also benefited from hosting WordCamps and has approximately nine happening in various cities. They are working towards hosting a WordCamp India in the future. There are also emerging communities in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s time for pursuing WordCamp Asia,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;We really have good talents here in Asia but we lack exposure. WordCamp Asia can create buzz and make more people aware, inspire, and provide opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:10:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: Jesse Petersen, Founder of Genesis The.me Passes Away";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72772";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"https://wptavern.com/jesse-petersen-founder-of-genesis-the-me-passes-away";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8085:"<img />Petersen Family\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpetersen">Jesse Petersen</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.genesisthe.me/">Genesis The.me</a> and <a href="https://www.petersenmediagroup.com/">Petersen Media Group</a>, has <a href="https://www.newlungsfor.me/2017/jesse-petersen-has-passed-away/">passed away</a> at the age of 38. Petersen had been battling <a href="http://www.cffatboy.com/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/">Cystic Fibrosis</a> for the past several years and suffered a massive lung bleed earlier today. He passed out before paramedics could reach him and could not be revived at the emergency room.</p>\n<p>Petersen was on a double-lung transplant list with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_allocation_score">lung allocation score</a> of 38.859.

The call for the perfect lungs for me will come in God’s timing. I am content to wait.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On July 2nd, a patient with a higher LAS score than Petersen&#8217;s was taken into surgery to receive a double-lung transplant.

From those who knew him personally, Petersen was a great husband, father, and a caring individual who despite his medical situation, would help out the best way he could. There are two stories that highlight the kind of person he was. The first is <a href="https://twitter.com/jpetersen/status/881974173085691904">a Twitter thread</a> he published two days ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you meet a 5 year-old who needs a heart and double-lung transplant but has been turned down everywhere, your situation doesn’t seem so bad. That family doesn’t care about politics, social class, keeping up with the Joneses, or whether their clothes match. They are enjoying life.</p>\n<p>Because when it comes down to it, all we really need is to know our worth and love everyone else because they have equal worth. That doesn’t mean you have to agree with everyone, but you don’t have to seek out opposition or turmoil. Random acts of kindness rock.</p>\n<p>Can you look over your life and say you’d be leaving those connected to you better off having known you? If not, start today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The second is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jesse.dubyah/posts/238778876639367">from his Facebook account</a> about an encounter he had with a mother pushing her small boy in a wheelchair with a surgical mask on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I finally got out of the house to go do a God &amp; Country service followed by fireworks. While waiting to go outside, a mom I&#8217;d seen pushing a small boy in a wheelchair with a surgical mask and oxygen on him came over to me.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I just wanted to say how cool I think your double tank cart is. I&#8217;m going to call my supplier tomorrow to get one for our wheelchair.&#8217;</p>\n<p>We started talking (most unlike me) and she said her son needed a heart and a double lung transplant&#8230; but they&#8217;ve been turned down everywhere, starting with the very forgiving Pittsburgh center.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8217;</p>\n<p>[nodded her head with a pained look] &#8216;We&#8217;re just making the most of our time now.&#8217;</p>\n<p>My heart broke.

Eghbal works in community programs at GitHub to better support people doing open source work. Rogers is the community manager at the Node.js Foundation. The episode focuses on the human aspect of the world of open source software and what inspires people to work together to give software away for free.</p>\n<p>Through Eghbal&#8217;s research on sustaining open source communities, she found, as Rogers succinctly summarized on the show: &#8220;There&#8217;s no connection between the number of users and the number of people maintaining a project.&#8221; The <a href="http://heartbleed.com/" target="_blank">Heartbleed Bug</a>, which arrested public attention when it was disclosed in 2014, is perhaps one of the most critical examples of an open source project with a global user base and a grossly disproportionate number of maintainers.</p>\n<p>As part of her research at GitHub, Eghbal is working on creating a vocabulary to explain things that are happening with open source projects. One example is the distinction between &#8220;popular&#8221; versus &#8220;healthy&#8221; when describing projects in terms of the communities behind them, governance, quality of maintainership, and other factors that influence a project&#8217;s condition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the dialogue tends to be set by popular projects, and those developers and their problems tend to dominate the story about this, you have these words and vocabulary like &#8216;drive-by-contributions,''&#8221; Rogers said. This often implies that maintainers are too busy to look at the code. Rogers advocated for changing this perception of &#8220;drive-by-contributors&#8221; to view them as casual contributors, people who show up and have value to add. If maintainers can seize these contributions as an opportunity, they will have a better chance of leveling up contributors to be a more active part of their organization.</p>\n<p>The group also discussed how technology has caused a cultural shift among open source communities from the old world versus the new world of open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In older open source, part of the barrier to entry that people went through before they were ever identifiable to any contributor was an acclimation to the culture and an acclimation to the tool chain and all this stuff,&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;One of the things that GitHub has done is completely remove all of that cultural acclimation. There is one tool chain that you use to contribute to any project and when you show up you don&#8217;t have all of this cultural knowledge. You haven&#8217;t bought into any of these ideals about open source necessarily. You&#8217;re just there to contribute. We actually need to work with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past, contributors informally acclimated to the culture through the onboarding process, and most software projects were more self-contained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where that becomes awkward today is that so many different pieces of software depend on other open source projects, which wasn&#8217;t actually true 10 or 20 year ago,&#8221; Eghbal said. With so many projects fitting into others as dependencies, it becomes more difficult to actually remove a project from the public domain. Open source licensing ensures that these projects have a life of their own. This has democratized entrepreneurship, making it easy for people to piece together technology to build applications and businesses. It also requires a higher level of skills for people working together across various open source projects and cultures.</p>\n<p>Eghbal and Rogers discussed the qualities of a healthy open source community, such as how welcoming the project is and how contributors speak to each other and resolve conflict. The ability to successfully resolve conflict can make the difference between a healthy growth of contributors or attrition on a project. Rogers mentioned a related conversation they had with Karl Fogel on their <a href="https://changelog.com/rfc" target="_blank">Request for Commits podcast</a> concerning conflict within projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we were talking to Karl, he has this view that &#8216;As long as a it has an open source license, it doesn&#8217;t matter how dysfunctional the project is, because we as a community always have this ability to fork it,''&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t agree with him on this, because the practical reality of forking a project is such a huge overhaul and you don&#8217;t necessarily have the right people to do it in your particular time. What you actually want are the healthy communities with healthy practices, what you want is to keep them going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another open source predicament they discussed, which is fairly common in the WordPress ecosystem, is when a company releases a project as open source or &#8220;gifts it to the community.&#8221; Eghbal likened this to &#8220;sending your dog away to a farm upstate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to announce this is now open source, meaning we don&#8217;t want to take care of it anymore,&#8221; she said. &#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;ll give it to the community,&#8217; (except they haven&#8217;t actually identified anyone in the community who wants to take care of it.)&#8221; This type of situation shows how &#8220;giving back to the community&#8221; isn&#8217;t always what it appears to be for those who end up using these projects that have been released into the wild.</p>\n<p>The group also discussed how the incentives for people to contribute to open source have changed over the years and why &#8220;the GitHub generation&#8221; has more readily adopted the MIT license.

I was born in Sardinia, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, and as a child I dreamt about becoming an air hostess.</p>\n<p>I wanted to travel the world and speak tons of foreign languages, to be able to communicate with local people everywhere I’d go.</p>\n<p>But people kept telling me that I wasn’t going to become tall enough for that job (genetics don’t lie!), and I eventually listened to them. I ended up choosing a different path in life, following the Italian mantra: “You have to study something that will guarantee a stable and secure job for life”.</p>\n<p>Even if I wasn’t that much convinced about the perspective of having the same job for all my life, as my parents did, at the same time I didn’t want to get stuck in the island forever: the unemployment rate in Sardinia is unfortunately really high and I didn’t want to risk to be part of that percentage.</p>\n<h3>Crossing the borders of the island</h3>\n<p>So I chose the Faculty of Economics and did my best to cross the borders of my island as soon as I had the chance: this happened when I was 22 and I moved to Siena, Tuscany, to finish my studies. That is also the time when I opened my first personal blog on an Italian platform named Tiscali, which I later migrated to WordPress.com.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve always loved writing</strong>, and since I was a little girl I used to spend hours in my room writing stories and poems. I was doing the same with the blog but with the advantage of reaching a much larger public, virtually meeting many people and getting inspired by their stories.</p>\n<p>After 2 years in Tuscany I moved to Strasbourg, France. There I learnt French and did several little jobs, but I found my first important one in Milan, the big city shining with job opportunities for everyone —as Italians love to say.</p>\n<p>There I was, fulfilling the dream of many young people of my age (and their families): I was 25, with an average-paid 40 hours/week office job in the marketing department of a big international company, and I was surrounded by ambitious colleagues and a boss constantly asking for extra —and free— working hours per day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was feeling like a parrot inside a golden cage.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It seemed to me I wasn’t going anywhere. I also gave up blogging because I wasn’t feeling inspired enough to write. People constantly repeated to me that I was super lucky to have a permanent contract and work in a marketing department; in their eyes I was all set for life, so —using some strange equation — I also had to be happy!</p>\n<p>Of course I was luckier than many of my peers, but I kept asking myself if I really wanted to do that life forever.<br />\nDid I really want to keep on working 10 hours per day under the neon lights of an office, annihilate my dreams and live waiting for the free time of the weekend?</p>\n<p>The most vivid memory I have of that period is the overwhelming feeling clenching my throat on Sunday afternoons, when I started to dread the moment of coming back to the office the day after.</p>\n<h3>Facing new challenges</h3>\n<p>So I left and faced the change. At the beginning I gave myself the opportunity to test different office jobs. But the results were always the same: I kept feeling unsatisfied with my life, and I understood I had to respect my little girl’s dream and fly away from my golden cage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I opted for emigration and moved alone to Barcelona, Spain, in 2012.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first move was plunging myself into a few months of intense Spanish learning at the University, then I found a job in an international Assisted Reproduction Clinic.</p>\n<p>My job title was “Patient Coordinator” and I was assisting international patients coming to Barcelona for their treatments: I was their translator, interpreter and administrative consultant. Patients were from Italy, France, England, Morocco, Senegal…it was a Babylon of people with so many different backgrounds that I felt really inspired by some of their stories.<br />\nThis inspiration led me to start writing again: <strong>I dusted off my WordPress blog</strong> and filled it up with stories about my new life in Barcelona and some of the women I was meeting at the Clinic. I was feeling stronger and more independent than ever.</p>\n<p>The job at the Clinic lasted for 3 years. Even if it was really inspiring, it was also very stressful. Imagine being a 30-something woman speaking all day long about fertility problems with women struggling to have a baby.</p>\n<p>I realized I was getting too involved and decided to look around to see what I could do next.</p>\n<h3>How can I find a job like this?</h3>\n<p>It was summer 2015 and I was at my desk, in my little tiny apartment in front of Barcelona’s beach. I was writing in my blog and I got stuck in a technical problem. While I was searching through the WordPress.com documentation, I saw a pop-up in the bottom right corner of my screen: an Automattician wrote me to ask if I needed help. I gladly accepted her offer, we chatted for a few minutes, the problem was solved and I could go back to my writing. But I also left the chat with one question: <strong>how could that person on chat find a support job with WordPress</strong>?</p>\n<p>Curious as I am, I started looking for an answer and I stumbled upon the official WordPress job page: <a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net">jobs.wordpress.net</a></p>\n<p>There I found a job offer that caught my attention: WP Media, a French startup, was looking for <strong>a polyglot and remote customer service teammate</strong> for one of their plugins, WP Rocket. I read their requirements: fluency in English, French and possibly another language, great experience with WordPress, some coding skills.</p>\n<p>That offer was calling me, I felt it.</p>\n<p><strong>I knew I didn&#8217;t have all the requirements</strong>, but hey, I could speak 4 languages, and I had a WordPress blog…right? Of course, I didn’t know anything about PHP, I had always been a WordPress.com user until that moment and I didn’t really know how to manage a self-hosted website or use a cache plugin…but I felt I was ready to learn all that. And moreover, what did I have to lose?</p>\n<h3>I wrote my most inspired cover letter and sent my CV.</h3>\n<p>With my total surprise, they answered me the day after and we set up an interview by Skype. My main strengths were the fluency in 4 languages and my previous experience in customer service, so I was really confident about those skills; yet I wanted to be totally honest with them: yes, I had been using WordPress for a long time, and yes, I was digital savvy enough, but I knew very little on the technical side. I had always worked on the front end of websites, writing, blogging, learning by myself; I didn&#8217;t know anything about the backend of WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>Even so, they had faith in me and in a few days I had the confirmation: I was in! <strong>During the first days I felt so happy about this new major turning point in my life</strong>: not only had I found a job thanks to my primordial passion, speaking foreign languages, but for the first time in my life I could do that job from home or anywhere else I liked, instead of being caged in a formal office!</p>\n<p>I got introduced to my remote teammates and I instantly felt welcomed.</p>\n<h3>Learning by doing</h3>\n<p>But, very soon, that initial enthusiasm started to struggle with another intense feeling: <strong>the fear of exposing my inexperience</strong>.</p>\n<p>There were too many things I didn&#8217;t know!</p>\n<p>Working in a WordPress backend was so new to me that I started studying like crazy and reading everything I could about WordPress for beginners. I went through some really intense months of learning by doing, supported by my teammates. Like a baby who start crawling and then taking little steps, I was initially answering the easiest tickets from our customers.  At the same my teammates were sending me useful material to read, setting up video-calls for 1to1 training, encouraging me every time they could.</p>\n<p>After a few days I received the first happy comments by the customers I was helping in their mother tongue: until that moment the plugin’s support had been offered only in English and French, so it was the first time Spanish and Italian customers were being answered in their own language…and they appreciated that!</p>\n<p>Even so, I can’t deny it, I was scared.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was so scary admitting my ignorance, exposing it in a remote environment where I couldn’t see my teammates reactions live.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first instinct was imagining the worst scenarios where they were secretly hating me for interrupting their work on Slack with my doubts.</p>\n<p>But I had no other choice than to keep asking questions and learn from their answers. Not doing so would have been much worse: silencing my voice would have slowed down my learning process.</p>\n<h3>Why don’t you try to contribute to WordPress?</h3>\n<p>We were at WordCamp Paris 2016 when one of my teammates showed me how the WordPress community worked together and kept in contact through Slack.</p>\n<p>“You speak multiple languages, why don’t you try to contribute to the polyglots team?” —he asked.</p>\n<p>That thought never crossed my mind before, I knew very little about contributing to WordPress. I had been working for WP Media for 6 months and, while I was enjoying my new job a lot, I was just slowly starting to abandon that overwhelming feeling of insecurity I mentioned above.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I didn’t feel ready to dive into a new challenge and start also contributing to WordPress, I thought I didn’t have the ability to do that. I was wrong, obviously.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Curiosity won on me another time and I joined the two Slack channels <em>Making WordPress</em> (where all the WP global community meets) and <em>Italia WP Community</em>. I lurked the channels for a few months, until I went to WordCamp Milan and met some members of the Italian Polyglots team.</p>\n<p>It was love at first string: Laura, one of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/?locale=it_IT">General Translation Editors</a> (GTE) for Italy, taught me how to start contributing and translating following the polyglots guidelines. She also told me about the big effort the Italian community has been doing to work together, consistently, to boost WordPress related events in Italy and to grow up.</p>\n<p>I wanted to be an active part of it and I started contributing.</p>\n<p><strong>Now I’m a Project Translator Editor for the Italian polyglots team</strong> and I mentor new contributors: I love it!</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of my journey into the WordPress world I traveled a lot, and also attended WordCamps in <a href="https://2016.paris.wordcamp.org/">Paris</a>, <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/">Vienna</a>, <a href="https://2016.milano.wordcamp.org/">Milan</a>, <a href="https://2016.barcelona.wordcamp.org/">Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://2017.torino.wordcamp.org/">Torino</a> and <a href="https://2017.bilbao.wordcamp.org/">Bilbao</a>.</p>\n<p>Following my teammates encouragement, <strong>I also started applying to WordCamps as a speaker</strong>, because I felt my story could be important for other people looking for new inspiration for their working and personal life. I gave my first talk in my adoptive city, Barcelona, in December 2016, then in Torino in April 2017 and I recently had the honor to tell my story also from the stage of WordCamp Europe 2017.</p>\n<p>In a short glimpse of time I engaged in many activities related to WordPress which allowed me to meet very interesting and inspiring people from all over the world.</p>\n<h3>I’m (not) lucky.</h3>\n<p>People keep telling me that I’m lucky, and it’s true, I really am. But if I’m here, now, sharing my story (and thanks Topher for inviting me to write it!) is not because I live under a lucky star: I just used my previous skills and passions and adapted them to a new career and life path.</p>\n<p>We all have some skills; and if we don’t know which they are exactly, we should take some time to make a list of the things we’re really good at. With that in mind, just try. Apply. Get involved. Don’t get stuck in the feeling of “I can’t do it because I don’t know enough”.</p>\n<p>That is what I did: without even realizing it, I started putting into reality the dream of the little girl who was born in an island and wanted to travel and speak different languages.</p>\n<p>WordPress made this possible: I’m part of a big community, and I am proud of it.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: How I tried, applied, got involved.

Despite being <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/do-not-miss-the-biggest-wordcamp-in-europe/" target="_blank">promoted</a> as &#8220;the largest WordPress event to this day&#8221; with more than 3,000 expected attendees, WCEU 2017 fell short with 1,900 people on the ground. Attendees were 5% fewer than last year&#8217;s 2,000 in Vienna. Expectations ran high but organizers could not predict the 24% no-show rate once the event got started. This is more than double the 10% no-show rate for the previous four years.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s organizers do not have a simple explanation for the high no-show rate, but cite several factors, including a few dozen participants being <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-attendees-are-being-denied-visas-because-conference-ticket-price-is-too-low" target="_blank">denied visas</a>, higher local sales, an expensive location, and putting tickets on sale too early. Approximately 60% of attendees were from nearby countries, such as France, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>Ticket sales for 2017 were open immediately at the conclusion of the 2016 event in Vienna. Organizers found that tickets sold in the first six months had a 34% no-show rate as compared to 20% for those sold in 2017. As the event has often sold out in the past, prospective attendees may have felt pressure to purchase a ticket in advance without confirming the ability to attend. </p>\n<p>Posting increasingly higher attendance numbers isn&#8217;t one of the goals of the WordCamp, but planning accurately for the number of people who will attend is crucial for resource and budget planning. When one in four attendees is a no-show, the plans for food, swag, venue accommodations, and other aspects of the event are askew.</p>\n<p>Organizers did not mention <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-kicks-off-with-contributor-day-focused-on-growing-wordpress-through-inclusion" target="_blank">Contributor Day</a> attendance in the wrap-up report, but this may have been one of the most successful aspects of the event. It was held prior to the main conference days, which may explain the event&#8217;s unusually high attendance numbers. Organizers hosted 473 attendees for the 500 available contributors slots. </p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2017 Cost 300€ per Attendee, Sponsors Covered 80%</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Europe&#8217;s wrap-up report also includes a transparent breakdown of the event&#8217;s 700k€ budget. Catering costs for lunches, snacks and drinks, made up 50% of the budget. However, organizers were limited to the venue&#8217;s catering partners, which blurs the line between actual food versus venue costs. </p>\n<p>The team was unable to sell all of the sponsorship packages and was forced to reduce the budget by 149k€ along the way. WordCamp Central subsidized 10€/ticket and covered the final deficit of 28k€. The cost breakdown per attendee was 300€ with sponsors covering 80%, WordCamp Central 7%, and tickets sales 13%. These numbers show that the 40€ ticket price is a small fraction of the total costs required for an event of this size. </p>\n<p>Organizers said they felt it was important to share the data for educational purposes but also to &#8220;demonstrate to everyone who might have a doubt, that maintaining the ticket fee very low is meant to make our events accessible to all, but that the fee is not an indicator of the value of the conference.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:06:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9049:"<p><i>We&#8217;re starting a new regular feature on this blog today. We&#8217;d like to keep everyone up-to-date about the happenings all across the WordPress open source project and highlight how you can get involved, so we&#8217;ll be posting a roundup of all the major WordPress news at the end of every month.</i></p>\n<p>Aside from other general news, the three big events in June were the release of WordPress 4.8, WordCamp Europe 2017, and the WordPress Community Summit. Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridget Willard <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li>A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li>The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li>It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href="https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li>The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li>After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href="https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li>If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 11:42:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: Gutenberg Contributors Explore Adding Drag-and-Drop and Multi-Column Support for Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72638";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6817:"<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/building-blocks.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: ruudgreven <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40811229@N07/6180817922">DSC_0012</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>The new Gutenberg editor has an open ticket for <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38#issuecomment-309998712" target="_blank">allowing users to sort blocks via drag and drop</a>. Blocks can currently be sorted with up and down arrows located to the left of the content but the beta only allows for single-column stacking.</p>\n<p>One of the goals for Gutenberg is to provide &#8220;a page building experience that makes it easy to create rich post layouts.&#8221; As far as layout building goes, the first planned versions of the new editor are very primitive as compared to Wix and Weebly&#8217;s drag and drop website builders where nearly every element on the page can be easily moved to a different position.</p>\n<p>Contributors have been discussing the intricacies of adding this feature to Gutenberg since February. James Nylen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38#issuecomment-309984280" target="_blank">summarized some of the challenges</a> that make drag and drop more complicated to implement: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Dragging and dropping a block is not really a one-step operation. It is more like 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press and hold mouse button or screen</li>\n<li>Move to desired location</li>\n<li>Release</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 is incredibly difficult to get right, and requires a lot of complicated behaviors like duplicating an item (or at least its general shape and size), scroll handling, and determining the intended new location, especially at the beginning and end of the content. We have all used bad drag-and-drop experiences, and I would argue they are worse than not having it at all.</p>\n<p>That said, for two-dimensional movement with columns, I agree that arrows alone are probably not a good solution. Though mobile support for that is going to be very tricky no matter how it works.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several commenters on the ticket agree that repeatedly clicking arrows to move blocks is cumbersome and will become untenable in the future when multi-column support is added. This would require up, down, right, and left arrows to rearrange content. Users have come to expect a drag-and-drop interface, because nearly every page builder application offers it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thinking of drag and drop as a progressive enhancement for desktops,&#8221; Joen Asmussen said. &#8220;One that would be great to have, but we should build it after we have explicit button actions in place for doing the same, including splitting into columns in the future. This decision is based on a desire to ensure accessibility as well as mobile devices can play the same game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asmussen marked the ticket priority as low in May and removed it from the beta milestone. At this point, users are not likely to see drag and drop in the first release that ships with WordPress core. </p>\n<h3>Multi-Column Layouts Planned for Gutenberg V2</h3>\n<p>The discussion surrounding adding drag-and-drop to the editor naturally leads into <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/219" target="_blank">adding multi-column support</a>. Limiting users to a single column is a one-dimensional approach to designing pages, but contributors don&#8217;t plan to leave Gutenberg without multi-column support for long. </p>\n<p>Geoarge Olaru, a designer at <a href="https://pixelgrade.com/" target="_blank">PixelGrade</a>, shared a <a href="https://invis.io/3FAS8VQE8#/222711568_Creating_Columns_-_0" target="_blank">prototype</a> for adding a simple two or three-grid column layout to Gutenberg. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Extending WordPress further from the default Blog Posts automatically implies the need of multi-column layouts for presentation pages,&#8221; Olaru said. &#8220;I would prefer to tackle this feature upfront, rather than letting every developer do it on his own (see the multitude of page builders plugins).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/multi-column-mockup.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;For the V1 editor, I&#8217;m afraid columns like this is out of scope,&#8221; Asmussen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/219#issuecomment-285330922" target="_blank">said</a> in reply to a Olaru&#8217;s ticket with mockups and a prototype for multi-column support. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a &#8216;no&#8217; — rather, we need some technical foundations to be solid first, before we commit to the really interesting stuff. But it might be a V1.1, or at the very least something for the customization folks later on in the year. Even before that, it would be good to keep this UI in mind, so that perhaps a plugin can add this even earlier.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Other commenters on the ticket feel more urgency about getting multi-column support into the first version of the editor. One of the concerns is that plugin developers will rush to add columns immediately based on demands from users, who will then have to migrate once core adds support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Multi column layouts are a must-have,&#8221; Anthony Hortin commented on the ticket. &#8220;At the moment, Gutenberg isn&#8217;t solving any issue. You still end up with one long column of content. The whole reason page builders are so popular, and why hundreds of thousands of people are using them, is because they provide the ability to easily make multi-column layouts. Without this functionality, you&#8217;re not providing any reason to use Gutenberg over a page builder plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the main challenges of adding multi-column support is figuring out what type of grid system to use and making sure that it scales from mobile to desktop. Weston Ruter joined the discussion to say that the foundational work for nested block support is being done now in version 1, but the UI for displaying them hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I appreciate the excitement and urgency to wanting columns,&#8221; Asmussen said. &#8220;We feel the same urgency. It&#8217;s not about not wanting columns, it&#8217;s purely about managing resources at this point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The good news is if you&#8217;ve been testing Gutenberg and wondering where some of these features are on the roadmap, they will be coming in later versions. While there may be disagreements about how much of a priority drag-and-drop and multi-column support should have for version 1, contributors agree that laying a solid technical foundation for these features is crucial for future extensibility.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 01 Jul 2017 19:06:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.3.0 Adds Front-End Styles for Core Blocks, Notices Framework, and Text and Image Quick Inserts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72646";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:125:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-3-0-adds-front-end-styles-for-core-blocks-notices-framework-and-text-and-image-quick-inserts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4557:"<p>Gutenberg development is marching ahead with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-june-30/" target="_blank">version 0.3.0</a> released today. New releases are shipping out on a weekly basis, so testers will get to discover another round of new additions after updating to the latest. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/#developers" target="_blank">changelog</a> has a full list of the 50 additions and improvements included in this release, but here&#8217;s a quick visual tour of a few of the most interesting user-facing features added this week.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg developers have <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1418" target="_blank">added front-end styles for core blocks</a>, which means that content like cover images will now appear the same as they look in the admin in the editor. The demo content in the plugin has also been <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1493" target="_blank">updated to display a full-width cover image</a>. Below is an example of a standard width cover image on the front-end.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cover-image-frontend.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 also includes new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1553" target="_blank">text and image quick inserts</a>, which appear when hovering over the blank space beneath the post content. This makes it faster to add the types of content that are used most frequently.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/text-and-image-quick-inserts.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1437" target="_blank">framework for notices</a>, which provides developers with reusable notices components, showing how to trigger notices and where they will show up. Gutenberg now displays <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1564" target="_blank">notices on post save, schedule, and update</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-notices.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 adds a new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1555" target="_blank">block descriptions component</a> to blocks with inspector controls. Several of the core blocks now display descriptions. These will be especially useful when plugin developers begin adding their own custom blocks, offering users a quick way to see the purpose of the block.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/block-description-e1498855903121.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds more placeholder text to various blocks, as &#8220;placeholders are key,&#8221; according to the newly added <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Gutenberg&selectedStory=Design&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=1&downPanel=storybooks%2Fstorybook-addon-knobs" target="_blank">design blueprints and principles</a> included in Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If your block can have a neutral placeholder state, it should. An image placeholder block shows a button to open the media library, a text placeholder block shows a writing prompt. By embracing placeholders we can predefine editable layouts, so all you have to do is fill out the blanks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 also adds several enhancements that make it easier to edit and customize the image-oriented blocks with more options and settings: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added “edit image” button to image and cover image blocks</li>\n<li>Added option to visually crop images in galleries for nicer alignment</li>\n<li>Added option to disable dimming the background in cover images</li>\n<li>Added option to display date and to configure number of posts in LatestPosts block</li>\n<li>Added text formatting to CoverImage block</li>\n<li>Added toggle option for fixed background in CoverImage</li>\n<li>Added placeholder for all text blocks</li>\n<li>Added placeholder text for headings, quotes, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Active installs for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank">Gutenberg plugin</a> have nearly doubled since last week and are at more than 900 sites. This is roughly 1% of the goal Matt Mullenweg set for testing on 100,000 sites before replacing the edit screen. The plugin may also be advertised in the dashboard in a future release, possibly 4.8.1, which is slated for the end of July.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 22:07:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Popular WordPress Plugins Slow to Add Meta Box Support for Calypso";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71527";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"https://wptavern.com/popular-wordpress-plugins-slow-to-add-meta-box-support-for-calypso";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3361:"<p>During the State of the Word at WordCamp US 2016, Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">announced</a> that Calypso was <a href="https://youtu.be/Nl6U7UotA-M?t=37m1s">plugin aware</a>. Calypso is a REST API and React <a href="https://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress">powered application</a> for the desktop created by Automattic <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/">in 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers with plugins active on 1M sites or more <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/10517">received an email invitation</a> from Andy Peatling to begin building support for Calypso.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Calypso is now plugin-aware,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;This pull request was merged today, and as a way to bootstrap this, we’re opening up for what I just described for plugins to create Calypso interfaces for what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically saying, if you’re using Calypso on a site that has one of these plugins, let’s say WooCommerce, all of a sudden in the interface, there will be all the WooCommerce stuff. It’ll talk to the API, it will run on the desktop just like the rest of Calypso, and it will only be loaded if the plugin is active.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the major differences between <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso</a> and WP-Admin is that custom meta boxes added by plugins are not accessible in Calypso.</p>\n<p>Nearly seven months since the announcement, popular WordPress plugins have struggled to add meta box support, including those maintained by Automattic. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO</a>, active on more than 3M sites, is among the plugins that were selected to take part in the experiment.</p>\n<p>When asked about the progress of making WordPress SEO Calypso aware, Joost de Valk, founder of <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast.com</a>, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Automattic has seen little progress on the initiative, &#8220;No news to report at this time, but hope to have some soon,&#8221; Automattic representative Mark Armstrong said. WooCommerce has yet to add meta box support and settings pages in Calypso.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg, WordPress&#8217; new editor, is also built using React. One of the chief concerns expressed by users and developers is how it will <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952">support custom meta boxes</a> built using the current PHP framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I miss a lot of the meta boxes I’m used to seeing on the screen,&#8221; <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin said</a>. &#8220;Things like Yoast SEO (on some sites) and custom taxonomies are just not shown. If every meta box ever made for WordPress needs to be remade, it sure is going to make developers lives a living hell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I want to use Calypso as a replacement for WP-Admin because it&#8217;s fast and I like the interface. However, I can&#8217;t do that until it supports meta boxes for the plugins I rely on, such as Edit Flow. Is the lack of custom meta box support for Calypso a sign of what&#8217;s to come with Gutenberg?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:05:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: WordCamp Netherlands Reinstated for 2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72624";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-netherlands-reinstated-for-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1924:"<p>At WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to speak with WordCamp Netherlands organizers Marcel Bootsman and Luc Princen, along with WordPress Global Community Team members Josepha Haden and Andrea Middleton.

Although it is just a minor update, the release was a large undertaking with 1,600 commits from 84 contributors. </p>\n<p>The most exciting feature in 3.1 is the new built-in product importer/exporter that supports CSV files, a feature previously offered through extensions. The importer makes it easier to migrate stores from other e-commerce platforms, as well as add and update product information for existing stores. Users can select whether to update existing products or create new products and can map the data against product fields:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/woo-product-importer.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The tool is also useful for those selling across multiple storefronts or marketplaces and is capable of matching up data based on product ID or SKU. Please note that it only handles products and not customers and orders. Store owners looking to import those additional items will still need to use an extension.</p>\n<p>Version 3.1 also introduces the ability to manage WooCommerce.com extension licenses within WooCommerce core, eliminating the need to install the helper extension and copy subscription keys over. Customers can now connect their WooCommerce.com account to the site and download, manage, and activate extensions in the admin. Developers or agencies that have purchased extensions on behalf of clients will need to contact WooCommerce to transfer the subscriptions to a new owner in order for them to show up within the clients&#8217; admin. </p>\n<p>This release also includes several other improvements, including the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add oEmbeds to the product short description, more useful error messages</li>\n<li>More useful error messages</li>\n<li>Add oEmbeds to the product short description</li>\n<li>Customers can accept ‘Terms and conditions’ without leaving checkout</li>\n<li>Set stock statuses for variations in bulk from the edit product screen</li>\n<li>Small improvements to the setup wizard</li>\n<li>WooCommerce Services Plugin: Add live shipping rates for USPS and Canada Post and print discounted shipping labels for USPS without leaving the store</li>\n<li>New search helpers for orders to allow developers to query orders by multiple props</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to 3.0 due to extension incompatibilities. This is one of the reasons why WooCommerce recommends making backups of your store and testing the 3.1 update on a staging site to see how it affects themes and extensions. The changes in 3.1 should be backwards compatible with 3.0.x sites, but impact on extensions needs to be tested before pushing the update live.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:30:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: WordPress Opens Up More Channels for Gutenberg Testing and Feedback";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=72583&preview=true&preview_id=72583";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-opens-up-more-channels-for-gutenberg-testing-and-feedback";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3501:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/testing.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/23YKF6ZUWV">Vojtech Okenka</a>\n<p>Gutenberg testing is in full swing and the WordPress Testing Handbook has a new page to help users <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">get started</a>. It clearly defines the purpose of the new block editor as not just for writing content but also for creating layouts. Users are invited to offer general feedback or engage in specific task-based tests.</p>\n<p>The new testing page erases boundaries for feedback by allowing users to submit their thoughts and suggestions using an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCVZ5ooeVYzjp26LAxKZVgkvcRraSTD6pRM_cjGuJfvLKQKw/viewform">online form</a>. Previously, the only way to offer feedback was by creating an issue on <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">GitHub</a> or contacting the contributors on WordPress&#x27; #core-editor Slack channel. </p>\n<p>At this stage in Gutenberg development, it may be difficult to discern what is a bug versus what is an unpolished feature. WordPress is using Storybook, an interactive development and testing environment for React and React-Native UI components, to create <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/">Gutenberg&#x27;s documentation</a>. However, this collection of documents focuses more on technical details for developers. The plugin&#x27;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/#developers">changelog</a> may provide some information about which features should be working. Before reporting an issue in the feedback form, it&#x27;s a good idea to review the project&#x27;s <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues">GitHub issues</a> to see if it has already been logged.</p>\n<h3>Testing Gutenberg Outside of the WordPress&#x27; Developer Community is Critical to Its Success</h3>\n<p>A few weeks ago I helped one of my friends migrate her personal blog from Blogger to WordPress. She had put off setting up her new site for months after checking out the admin and getting overwhelmed. Getting familiar with the post editor was enough of a hurdle, without piling on the idea of widgets and shortcodes and different screens and methods for inserting different types of content. The new editor can solve this problem with a unified method of creating content and placing it on the page.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg has the potential to make WordPress content editing and layout building more user-friendly but only if it gets into the hands of non-technical users and those who are considering a switch from other platforms. WordPress&#x27; recurring <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-editor-experience-survey-shows-75-of-respondents-dont-use-distraction-free-writing-mode">failure to collect feedback beyond its own development community</a> needs to be addressed if Gutenberg is going to become a product that will attract non-WordPress users.</p>\n<p>As the plugin is still in the very early beta stage, this is a crucial point in time when feedback can have a big impact on shaping Gutenberg&#x27;s development. Including non-technical users as early in the process as possible, as the new <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">testing page</a> attempts to do, should provide a better overall picture of Gutenberg&#x27;s usability.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 20:30:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"WPTavern: Why Gutenberg?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72563";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wptavern.com/why-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7502:"<p>At WordCamp Europe 2017, Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of the WordPress open source project, <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing">announced</a> that Gutenberg was available as a plugin for testing. In the past few weeks, members of the community have published their experiences with the new editor. Some of the reviews I&#8217;ve read so far include:</p>\n<ul class="wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform">\n<li><a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/"><cite></cite>Random Thoughts on Gutenberg </a></li>\n<li><a href="https://joost.blog/gutenberg-and-yoast-seo/">Gutenberg and Yoast SEO </a></li>\n<li><a href="http://gschoppe.com/wordpress/improving-wordpress/improving-wordpress-pt-4-where-project-gutenberg-lost-me-open-letter-to-core/">Improving WordPress Pt 4 – Where Gutenberg Lost Me (Open Letter to Core) </a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wplift.com/gutenberg-editor-first-look">A First Look at Gutenberg Editor for WordPress: Mixed Opinions </a></li>\n<li><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Diving Into the New Gutenberg WordPress Editor (Pros and Cons) </a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.customerservant.com/gutenberg-screen-reader-initial-thoughts-reactions/">Gutenberg With A Screen Reader: Initial Thoughts And Reactions </a></li>\n<li><a href="https://mrwweb.com/first-reactions-gutenberg-future-of-wordpress/">First Reactions to Gutenberg, the Future of WordPress</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is one review in particular that has piqued my interest. Adrian Roselli not only <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/06/first-reactions-to-gutenberg.html">shares his first impressions</a> of Gutenberg, but also asks a couple of important questions and raises some interesting points:</p>\n<blockquote class="blocks-quote-style-1 wp-block-quote"><p>When I first heard about Gutenberg, I asked some people at WordCamp London and later at WordCamp Europe who had requested it. Remembering that WordCamp is open source, I then re-jiggered my question and asked what problem it was trying to solve.</p>\n<p>Of the people I asked, I do not know who was a contributor. The answer I overwhelmingly got back was that Matt wanted it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two things that concern me about Roselli&#8217;s statement. The first is that I have a few quirks with the current editor but I don&#8217;t often use short codes, custom HTML, or use custom embed codes. Thinking about what <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/aae8cdd1349c6af7a74e84174724526386643a6e/docs/design.md">problems Gutenberg solves</a> is somewhat perplexing if they&#8217;re not problems I encounter on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The second is that people at WordCamps are answering the question by saying Mullenweg wants it in core. Roselli states that he doesn&#8217;t know if the people answering the question are contributors or not. Because Mullenweg wants something in core should never be the primary reason it&#8217;s added.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how one could come up with this answer. Earlier this year, Mullenweg took over core development as the project lead, and <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle">assigned</a> Automattic employees Matias Ventura and Joen Asmussen to lead the development of Gutenberg. As project lead, Mullenweg can bypass the <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-discusses-core-focuses-downsides-of-a-consensus-driven-model-and-more-on-apply-filters-podcast">concensus-driven model</a>, and do what he thinks is best for the project without going through a committee.</p>\n<p>In the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">2016 State of the Word</a>, Mullenweg announced that the Editor would be one of three core focuses for 2017. In January of this year, the team published a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/17/editor-technical-overview/">technical overview</a> of what the new editor would encompass. A month later, the team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/02/09/initial-editor-blocks-prototype-editor-testing/">published an initial prototype</a> of a block-based editor.</p>\n<p>The team is moving rapidly with <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-to-focus-on-managing-plugins-and-themes-gutenberg-targeted-for-5-0">plans to ship Gutenberg</a> possibly in time for WordPress 5.0 expected later this year or early next. If all of the work thus far had to go through a committee, it&#8217;s likely Gutenberg development wouldn&#8217;t be where it&#8217;s at.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not enough people <a href="http://chrislema.com/misunderstanding-goal-gutenberg-writing-experience/">understand the &#8216;Why&#8217; behind the project.</a> Who can blame them? Outside of specifying that it will help WordPress <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing">leapfrog its competitors</a>, there&#8217;s not a lot of information on official channels that concretely explains and supports the idea that Gutenberg is necessary for millions of users.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has a good track record of doing what&#8217;s best for the project. However, in the case of revamping the editor, which will radically change how everyone will create content in WordPress, it&#8217;s concerning that more user research, personas, usage data, etc. is not available to indicate such a major shift was warranted. There was an <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-editor-experience-survey-shows-75-of-respondents-dont-use-distraction-free-writing-mode">Editor survey published</a> earlier this year but the results were not representative of WordPress&#8217; global user base.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of assertions on ease of use are made on the Gutenberg plugin page, with nothing to back them up,&#8221; Roselli said.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is an exciting, ambitious project, but one that I&#8217;m not entirely sure is necessary. If WordPress core is going to fundamentally change the way I create content without giving me a choice, I want as much information and user research data as possible to convince me that it&#8217;s the better option.</p>\n<p>It may seem odd that these questions and concerns are being raised six months into the project but at the same time, development has moved so fast, it feels like the opportunity to have them addressed at the beginning was missed.</p>\n<p>Revamping the editor experience is a massive undertaking and, six months in, it&#8217;s not better than the editor I use today. I wrote this post in Gutenberg and it was a cumbersome, frustrating experience. It will need to address a lot of issues if it&#8217;s going to beat the current WordPress editor, let alone leapfrog its competitors. However, the team is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg/">making good progress</a> on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg needs as many testers as possible if it&#8217;s going to be the best editor in its class.

It picked me. I can remember the summer between kindergarten and first grade; I had a computer summer class that introduced me to my passion. The first day when my mother picked me up I exclaimed “mommy I want a computer for Christmas!” I was five and had no realization that in 1986 they would cost more than about everything I owned. I remember being upset that Santa did not bring me the computer that I had been wishing for since June. Growing up, any time I got the chance to sit in front of a computer, I took it for as long as I could. In high school, I even designed the website of one of the groups I was in. It was still online up until last year when CCHS did a website redesign. However, I never actively pursued a career with computers or even took a class for them since that summer. It was not until after I got into WordPress that I actually took a computer class, and now I have an associate&#8217;s in Information Technology.</p>\n<p>My first career was as a preschool teacher. I loved teaching, loved the joy that it gave me, but it was a very under-valued career.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most teachers, who go to college to become teachers, make anywhere between minimum wage to a dollar over that with no insurance and maybe a week’s paid vacation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While spending 45 plus hours every week, I was dedicated to teaching our future, I was barely getting bills paid. So many times I would have to pay bills late, worry how I was going to make sure the next bill gets paid, and have enough gas in my car to make it to work the rest of the week. I devoted twelve years to teaching colors, shapes, letters, numbers, and how to get along with others. While I loved to teach, I needed more. Plus, if I wanted to be able to take care of my daughter, I needed to make a change or I would never even be able to have a savings.</p>\n<h3>And Then There Was WordPress</h3>\n<p>Around 2011, I got the idea that I wanted to write a blog. I had heard my friend Chris talk about blogging so I knew he would point me in the right direction. At that time he was working on a security plugin to help the sites he managed for work. He told me “if you want me to help you build a blog, I&#8217;m going to teach you so you can do it on your own later.” We bought a domain, set up hosting, and ran the install. I instantly became hooked. The more I built, the more I wanted to learn about WordPress, and the more I wanted to do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Almost every night, after my daughter would go to bed, I would spend working on my blog, reading about what one can do with WordPress, and trying everything I learned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes things would go great, and other times I would accidentally delete out my entire site on FileZilla without a backup and would start from scratch again. Most of my learning came from my failed attempts and what not to do. That is what was my first clue that I would like to be a “fixer” instead of a “builder”.</p>\n<p>The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. By 2013 I decided that “I could actually do this. I could make money from WordPress” but I still had about zero clue of how to go about it. I decided to leave preschool for good. I took a full time job working for a local IT agency that also built sites on WordPress. I spent a year there but during that time Chris introduced me to Regina at WP Security Lock. We hit it off and I quickly became a part time employee in April of 2014 helping her with the sites she managed and then learning how to clean hacked websites.</p>\n<p>I spent almost two years working for WPSL. The first part of them I was working for the local agency. Regina showed me another option for working in WordPress. It was the idea of working remotely. My daughter was still at the age where she needed after school care, and it is expensive. So with the support of my then fiance, I took the leap to work remotely in September of 2014.</p>\n<p>Fast forward from working in with various plugin support teams and security support roles, to jumping into agency support that I did for almost a year, I am now at home with WP Media on their WP Rocket support team. While most do not feel that it is the most glamorous of career choices, I love fixing problems, finding solutions, and helping people. Most of all, WordPress and working with support, gives me many teaching opportunities to help out every person who asks.</p>\n<h3>The Want to Teach</h3>\n<p>My first ever WordPress Community event was WP Engine’s 10 year birthday party they threw for WordPress in Austin. The feeling the Austin WP community gave me led me to feel like this was really a place I wanted to be. After Chris saw how excited I was about the community, he asked if I would like to go to WordCamp Chicago. Coincidentally, four years ago today, I was attending my first ever WordCamp. How the speakers taught the attendees, my goal was to learn as much as I could about WordPress so I too, can teach.</p>\n<p>Even though I no longer had the official title of a teacher, I still loved to teach. WordCamp Austin 2014 gave me the first opportunity to teach others about Jetpack. I was a nervous wreck! Not only was my best friend there who I looked up to in the WordPress community, but also one of the wonderful Happiness Engineers for the Jetpack team. I had Kraft go over my slides for me to make sure there was not anything I was sticking my foot in my mouth for and away we went. Afterwards I had people coming up and thanking me for explaining Jetpack in a way they could understand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After that WordCamp, I wanted to speak at all WordCamps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the many advantages of working for companies that have roots in the WordPress Community is that they allow me to attend, speak, and volunteer at WordCamps. I now have over 20 speaking opportunities under my belt, and have no want to stop for the unforeseeable future. I love having any opportunity to teach. I have now grown from only speaking at WordCamps to teaching beginner’s WordPress at our local community college, writing a book on beginner’s WordPress, and starting WP Kids Slack group to be a resource for KidsCamps and teaching our youth on the value and joys of WordPress. Now I am proud to say that I have taught WordPress to all ages from children to the baby boomers and it feels great! I have even had the opportunity to teach my own daughter WordPress and she loves going to the WordCamps. She has even helped others at Camps which for me is what it is all about. It is such a delight teaching Kids Camps and seeing their creativity blossom while building a site of their own. Plus, getting youth and teenagers interested in WordPress, coding, design, and more ensures that what we are building now, will only become better in the future.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=From%20Teaching%20Toddlers%20to%20Teaching%20the%20World&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fteaching-toddlers-teaching-world%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fteaching-toddlers-teaching-world%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fteaching-toddlers-teaching-world%2F&title=From+Teaching+Toddlers+to+Teaching+the+World" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/teaching-toddlers-teaching-world/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/062817-min-150x150.jpg&description=From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/teaching-toddlers-teaching-world/" title="From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/teaching-toddlers-teaching-world/">From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 14:15:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Michele Butcher-Jones";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 22:19:21 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 22:00:21 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911110210";}', 'no');
